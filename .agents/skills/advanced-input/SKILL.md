description: System-level input polling, player movement control, and mobile on-screen controls in Decentraland. Covers inputSystem, InputModifier, PointerLock, PrimaryPointerInfo, and TouchScreenControls. Use when the user wants continuous key polling, WASD-controlled entities, to freeze the player during a cutscene, FPS-style cursor lock, multi-key combo patterns, or to hide/customize the mobile joystick, crosshair, or on-screen buttons. For event-driven clicks and hover on entities see add-interactivity.

# Advanced Input Handling in Decentraland

For basic click/hover events, see the `add-interactivity` skill. This skill covers advanced input patterns. Prefer `pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown()` (add-interactivity) for simple entity clicks; use `inputSystem` for complex multi-key or polling patterns.

## Pointer Lock State

Detect whether the cursor is captured (first-person mode) or free:

```typescript
import { engine, PointerLock } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

function checkPointerLock() {
  const isLocked = PointerLock.get(engine.CameraEntity).isPointerLocked

  if (isLocked) {
    // Cursor is captured — player is in first-person control
  } else {
    // Cursor is free — player can click UI elements
  }
}

engine.addSystem(checkPointerLock)
```

### Requesting / releasing pointer lock (writable)

`PointerLock.isPointerLocked` is a plain writable boolean — a scene can request or release cursor capture by mutating it (verified: `31,20-pointer-lock-control` sets it from click handlers and a timed system):

```typescript
PointerLock.createOrReplace(engine.CameraEntity, { isPointerLocked: false })
// request lock (e.g. from a button)
PointerLock.getMutable(engine.CameraEntity).isPointerLocked = true
// release lock
PointerLock.getMutable(engine.CameraEntity).isPointerLocked = false
```

PITFALL: `getMutable(engine.CameraEntity)` throws if `PointerLock` was never created on the camera. Call `PointerLock.createOrReplace(engine.CameraEntity, { isPointerLocked: false })` once in `main()` before mutating. Writing `true` is a _request_; the client/player may still control actual capture (e.g. Esc unlocks).

### Pointer Lock Change Detection

```typescript
PointerLock.onChange(engine.CameraEntity, (pointerLock) => {
  if (pointerLock?.isPointerLocked) {
    console.log('Cursor locked')
  } else {
    console.log('Cursor unlocked')
  }
})
```

## Cursor Position and World Ray

Get the cursor's screen position and the ray it casts into the 3D world:

```typescript
import { engine, PrimaryPointerInfo } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

function readPointer() {
  const pointerInfo = PrimaryPointerInfo.getOrCreateMutable(engine.RootEntity)
  console.log('Cursor position:', pointerInfo.screenCoordinates)
  console.log('Cursor delta:', pointerInfo.screenDelta)
  console.log('World ray direction:', pointerInfo.worldRayDirection)
}

engine.addSystem(readPointer)
```

### Field details

- `screenCoordinates` _(optional Vector2)_ — cursor position in pixels. **Origin is the top-left corner of the screen** (positive Y = down — the same space as `UiTransform`/`UiCanvasInformation`, so cursor coords drop straight into a UI `position`). When the cursor is locked, freezes at the screen center.
- `screenDelta` _(optional Vector2)_ — how many pixels the mouse moved since the last frame. Positive `x` = right, positive `y` = down (same top-left origin as `screenCoordinates`), so moving the mouse *up* reports a **negative** `y`. This caught the reference mouse-look scenes, which subtracted `delta.y` until sdk7-test-scenes `0e4eecf` corrected them. **Keeps reporting raw mouse movement while the cursor is locked** — unlike `screenCoordinates` and `worldRayDirection`, which freeze at screen center. This makes `screenDelta` the only way to read mouse movement during pointer lock, and the correct input for mouselook / FPS camera controls (see the **camera-control** skill's mouselook pattern). `screenDelta` is always 0 on mobile (no continuous cursor); `screenCoordinates` and `worldRayDirection` work on both platforms.
- `worldRayDirection` _(optional Vector3)_ — direction from the camera through the cursor. Freezes at center ray while locked.
- `pointerType` — `0` for none, `1` for mouse.

PITFALL: every field is optional — verified schema and `0,5-primary-cursor-info`, which guards each read (`pointerInfo.screenCoordinates?.x ?? -666`, `pointerInfo.worldRayDirection?.x.toFixed(2)`). Use `getOrCreateMutable(engine.RootEntity)` so the component exists before first read, and always null-check the fields. `worldRayDirection` feeds directly into a camera raycast direction (see the "spawn at cursor" pattern in that scene).

## Input Polling with inputSystem

### Per-Entity Input Commands

Check if a specific input action occurred on a specific entity:

```typescript
import { engine, inputSystem, InputAction, PointerEventType } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

function myInputSystem() {
  // Check for click on a specific entity
  const clickData = inputSystem.getInputCommand(
    InputAction.IA_POINTER,
    PointerEventType.PET_DOWN,
    myEntity
  )

  if (clickData) {
    console.log('Entity clicked via system:', clickData.hit.entityId)
  }
}

engine.addSystem(myInputSystem)
```

The returned command carries `hit` data (position and entity) — use `getInputCommand()` when you need to know what was clicked.

Pass `InputAction.IA_ANY` to match any action — `getInputCommand(InputAction.IA_ANY, PointerEventType.PET_DOWN)` returns a command for whatever key was pressed, and `cmd.button` tells you which one.

> **CORRECTION — "omit the entity argument to check globally" is wrong.** Omitting the entity does not mean "no target" or "the scene root". Verified in `@dcl/ecs/src/engine/input.ts`: both `isTriggered` and `getInputCommand` branch on `if (entity) { ...that entity's results... } else { ...globalState.thisFrameCommands... }`, and `thisFrameCommands` is filled by iterating `engine.getEntitiesWith(PointerEventsResult)` — i.e. **every entity in the scene**. So an entity-bound press satisfies the entity-less call, and you cannot tell a scene-root broadcast from a click on some cube.
>
> **Passing `engine.RootEntity` does not help either.** `RootEntity` is `0`, which is falsy, so `if (entity)` sends it down the _same_ all-entities branch. This has produced real misdiagnoses: in `149,149-synthetic-input-showcase` it made an input-suppression test read as broken across three runs, and armed a paint station from clicks on unrelated stations.
>
> **To genuinely read root-entity input**, read the root's own grow-only result set and track a timestamp watermark:
>
> ```typescript
> let lastRootTimestampSeen = 0
> engine.addSystem(() => {
>   let maxTimestamp = lastRootTimestampSeen
>   for (const cmd of PointerEventsResult.get(engine.RootEntity)) {
>     if (cmd.timestamp <= lastRootTimestampSeen) continue
>     if (cmd.timestamp > maxTimestamp) maxTimestamp = cmd.timestamp
>     if (cmd.state !== PointerEventType.PET_DOWN) continue
>     // ...handle the root-level press...
>   }
>   lastRootTimestampSeen = maxTimestamp
> })
> ```
>
> The same flaw is present in the `0,1-input-modifier` test scene (`getInputCommand(InputAction.IA_ANY, PointerEventType.PET_DOWN)` with no entity) — do not copy that line as a "global input" idiom.

For the Tag-based per-entity cookbook (mark entities with a Tag, fetch them with `engine.getEntitiesByTag`, and poll each with `getInputCommand` inside a system), see `{baseDir}/references/input-patterns.md` → "Per-Entity Input Command Cookbook (Tag-based)".

### Global Input Checks

Check if a specific key was pressed, regardless of if the player's cursor was pointing at an entity or not.

Use `isTriggered()` for one-shot actions (fire a weapon, open a door) — it returns true only on the frame the key is first pressed. Use `isPressed()` for continuous actions (movement, holding a shield) — it returns true every frame while held.

```typescript
function globalInputSystem() {
  // Was the key just pressed this frame?
  if (inputSystem.isTriggered(InputAction.IA_PRIMARY, PointerEventType.PET_DOWN)) {
    console.log('E key pressed!')
  }

  // Is the key currently held down?
  if (inputSystem.isPressed(InputAction.IA_SECONDARY)) {
    console.log('F key is held!')
  }
}

engine.addSystem(globalInputSystem)
```

### Cross-entity input interference (fixed in `@dcl/sdk` 7.28.0)

`2778e4bb`. The per-entity command scan walked an entity's commands newest-first and stopped as soon as it hit one no newer than the **global** button state — which an entity processed earlier in the _same frame_ had usually just written. The scan then abandoned that entity's remaining commands, including ones for other buttons.

Symptom on 7.27.x and earlier: **releasing the pointer over one entity while a key went down over another in the same frame lost the key.** `isPressed` and the global `isTriggered` both answered `false` while the per-entity `isTriggered` still said `true` — an inconsistency that made the bug look like a scene logic error.

The scan now stops at the frame boundary instead of at another entity's command. Nothing to change in scene code; just stop working around it, and be aware the old behavior is still live for anyone on an older SDK.

## All InputAction Values

| InputAction    | Key/Button                                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IA_POINTER`   | Left mouse button                                                |
| `IA_PRIMARY`   | E key                                                            |
| `IA_SECONDARY` | F key                                                            |
| `IA_ACTION_3`  | 1 key                                                            |

| `IA_ACTION_5`  | 3 key                                                            |
| `IA_ACTION_6`  | 4 key                                                            |
| `IA_JUMP`      | Space key                                                        |
| `IA_FORWARD`   | W key                                                            |
| `IA_BACKWARD`  | S key                                                            |
| `IA_LEFT`      | A key                                                            |
| `IA_RIGHT`     | D key                                                            |
| `IA_WALK`      | Control key                                                      |
| `IA_MODIFIER`  | Shift key (run)                                                  |
| `IA_ANY`       | Matches any input action (wildcard — use with `getInputCommand`) |

## Event Types

```typescript
PointerEventType.PET_DOWN         // Button/key pressed
PointerEventType.PET_UP           // Button/key released
PointerEventType.PET_HOVER_ENTER  // Cursor enters entity
PointerEventType.PET_HOVER_LEAVE  // Cursor leaves entity
```

## InputModifier (Movement Restriction)

Restrict or freeze the player's movement:

```typescript
import { engine, InputModifier } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

// Freeze player completely
InputModifier.create(engine.PlayerEntity, {
  mode: InputModifier.Mode.Standard({ disableAll: true })
})

// Restrict specific movement (all flags optional; a false/omitted flag is ignored)
InputModifier.createOrReplace(engine.PlayerEntity, {
  mode: InputModifier.Mode.Standard({
    disableWalk: true,
    disableJog: true,
    disableRun: true,
    disableJump: true,
    disableEmote: true,
    disableDoubleJump: true,
    disableGliding: true
  })
})

// Restore normal movement
InputModifier.deleteFrom(engine.PlayerEntity)
```

**Standard flags** (all optional booleans; verified `input_modifier.gen.d.ts`): `disableAll`, `disableWalk`, `disableJog`, `disableRun`, `disableJump`, `disableEmote`, `disableDoubleJump`, `disableGliding`. A `false`/omitted flag is ignored (consumes no bandwidth). `InputModifier.Mode.Standard({...})` and the raw `{ $case: 'standard', standard: {...} }` form are equivalent (both seen in test scenes).

**Important:** InputModifier only works in the DCL 2.0 desktop client. It has no effect in the web browser explorer — test with the desktop client if your scene relies on it.

### Cutscene Pattern

For the worked cutscene flow (freeze the player with `disableAll` during a cinematic, then restore movement with `InputModifier.deleteFrom`), see `{baseDir}/references/input-patterns.md` → "Cutscene Pattern (freeze player during a cinematic)".

## WASD Movement Pattern

For the WASD-driven custom-entity pattern (poll `IA_FORWARD`/`IA_BACKWARD`/`IA_LEFT`/`IA_RIGHT` with `isPressed` to move a `Transform`, plus the note on freezing the avatar with `InputModifier` and how polling WASD relates to player movement), see `{baseDir}/references/input-patterns.md` → "WASD Movement Pattern (drive a custom entity)".

## Combining Input Patterns

For the action-bar / number-key pattern (map `IA_ACTION_3`–`IA_ACTION_6` to ability slots via `isTriggered`), see `{baseDir}/references/input-patterns.md` → "Action Bar with Number Keys".

## Platform detection

Detect whether the scene is running on mobile to conditionally adapt controls and UI:

```typescript
import { getPlatform, isMobile } from '@dcl/sdk/platform'

// getPlatform() returns 'mobile' | 'desktop' | 'web' | null
// Returns null until the explorer reports its platform (async, shortly after scene start)
// Defer platform-dependent setup until getPlatform() is non-null:
function platformCheckSystem() {
  if (getPlatform() === null) return
  engine.removeSystem(platformCheckSystem)
  if (isMobile()) {
    // mobile-specific setup here (e.g. larger UI, touch-friendly interactions)
  }
}
engine.addSystem(platformCheckSystem)
```

Import from `@dcl/sdk/platform`. Verified against docs commit `17ca7be`.

## Player language (`getPlayerLanguage`)

[UNRELEASED — js-sdk-toolchain `201a8a35`, landed **after the 7.29.0 tag**. It ships in the next `@dcl/sdk` release; the first published build carrying it is the prerelease `7.29.1-35917671376.commit-046b268`. Check the scene's pin before using it.]

Same module, `@dcl/sdk/platform`. Use it to pick localized strings for UI text, NPC dialogue, signage, and hover text.

```typescript
import { getPlayerLanguage, onPlayerLanguageChanged } from '@dcl/sdk/platform'

const STRINGS: Record<string, string> = { en: 'Press E to open', es: 'Pulsa E para abrir' }

function label() {
	const lang = getPlayerLanguage()             // 'es', 'pt-BR', …
	return STRINGS[lang] ?? STRINGS[lang.split('-')[0]] ?? STRINGS.en
}

onPlayerLanguageChanged.add(({ language }) => {
	// the player switched the client language mid-session — rebuild any cached strings
})
```

- **`getPlayerLanguage(): string`** — a BCP-47 tag (`'es'`, `'pt-BR'`). Sourced from `getExplorerInformation().configurations['locale']`, with `_` normalized to `-` (`pt_BR` → `pt-BR`) and surrounding whitespace trimmed. A value that does not match `^[a-zA-Z]{2,3}(-[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,8})*$` falls back to `'en'`.
- **GOTCHA — it is synchronous and returns `'en'` until the explorer has answered.** Unlike `getPlatform()`, which returns `null` while unknown, there is no "not yet" value here: calling it in `main()` reliably gives you `'en'` on every client. Either read it inside a system after the first frames, or re-read it from `onPlayerLanguageChanged`.
- **`onPlayerLanguageChanged: Observable<{ language: string }>`** fires only on a *real* change (setting the same tag twice notifies once). Older clients never emit it.
- Returns `'en'` when the client reports no locale, when `configurations` is missing, and when the `getExplorerInformation` RPC rejects. Region subtags are passed through verbatim — match on the full tag first, then fall back to the primary subtag, then to `'en'`.
- Under the hood this adds a `localeChanged: { locale: string }` scene event to `IEvents`; **importing `@dcl/sdk/platform` subscribes to it for you**, so there is nothing to wire up.

## On-screen touch controls (`TouchScreenControls`)

Brief: configures the mobile client's **native** on-screen controls — the virtual joystick, the crosshair, and the gamepad buttons. SDK **7.26.0+**.

```typescript
import { engine, TouchScreenControls, InputAction } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
```

- Set it on **`engine.RootEntity`** — the client reads it nowhere else.
- Applied while the player is inside the scene; reverts to defaults on exit, so scenes that don't use it are unaffected.
- **No-op** on platforms without native on-screen controls (desktop), and no effect in VR. Safe to write unconditionally — no `isMobile()` guard needed.
- Covers **input controls only**. The client's own HUD (emote wheel, profile, chat, minimap) is not affected by this component.
- **If the scene uses the Creator Hub UI Designer, this component is the editor's.** Creator Hub 0.50.0+ ships a **MobileHUD** entry in the UI Designer that edits `TouchScreenControls` visually and owns `src/mobile-hud.ts` (lazily written, auto-deleted when the config returns to defaults). There is one component on `engine.RootEntity` and last write wins, so a hand-written `createOrReplace` elsewhere in such a scene clobbers the panel's config or gets clobbered by it. Check for `src/mobile-hud.ts` before writing `TouchScreenControls` by hand, and see the **build-ui** skill > "MobileHUD".

`PBTouchScreenControls` fields:

| Field           | Type                                 | Default     | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `touchInputs`   | `PBTouchScreenControls_TouchInput[]` | `[]`        | Per-button overrides. A button not listed keeps its default (shown, default glyph).          |
| `mainAction`    | `InputAction \| undefined`           | `undefined` | Which action the large central button triggers. When unset, the default (`IA_JUMP`) is kept. |
| `hideJoystick`  | `boolean`                            | `false`     | Removes the native virtual joystick.                                                         |
| `hideCrosshair` | `boolean`                            | `false`     | Hides the on-screen crosshair / reticle.                                                     |

`TouchInput` entry: `{ inputAction: InputAction, hide: boolean, icon?: TextureUnion }` — `icon` overrides the button glyph with a scene image; on `IA_JUMP` it replaces all of its dynamic states (jump / double-jump / glide).

**Only gamepad actions map to an on-screen button**: `IA_POINTER` (interaction), `IA_PRIMARY` (E), `IA_SECONDARY` (F), `IA_JUMP` (central), `IA_ACTION_3`..`IA_ACTION_6` (1/2/3/4). Any other `InputAction` — movement actions, `IA_ANY`, `IA_MODIFIER`, unknown/future values — is ignored: a `touchInputs` entry naming one has no effect, and a `mainAction` that isn't a valid gamepad action falls back to `IA_JUMP`.

Convenience helpers on the component (each writes `RootEntity` and merges with the current value, so they can be called from anywhere):

| Helper                                                     | Effect                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TouchScreenControls.hide(actions: InputAction[])`         | Hide the given buttons, merged into the current config.            |
| `TouchScreenControls.hideAll()`                            | Hide all eight gamepad buttons.                                    |
| `TouchScreenControls.showAll()`                            | Clear the button hide list. Does **not** touch joystick/crosshair. |
| `TouchScreenControls.setMainAction(action: InputAction)`   | Set the large central button's action.                             |
| `TouchScreenControls.hideJoystick()` / `.showJoystick()`   | Toggle the native virtual joystick.                                |
| `TouchScreenControls.hideCrosshair()` / `.showCrosshair()` | Toggle the crosshair / reticle.                                    |

```typescript
TouchScreenControls.hideJoystick()
TouchScreenControls.setMainAction(InputAction.IA_PRIMARY)
TouchScreenControls.hide([InputAction.IA_ACTION_3, InputAction.IA_ACTION_4])
```

Gotchas:

- `showAll()` resets `touchInputs` to `[]`, which also **discards any custom `icon`** set through it. Re-apply icons afterwards.
- Hiding a button does not disable the action — `inputSystem` still reports it if it can be triggered another way. Hiding removes the _button_, not the _input_.
- Hiding the joystick leaves mobile players with no native way to walk; replace it with scene UI or make the scene intentionally stationary.
- Buttons cannot be repositioned. Their slots are fixed; a scene only chooses which are visible and which one leads.

Raw form (what the helpers write for you) — note the nested `icon` shape, which is a `TextureUnion`, not a plain path. From `33,20-spectate-mode`:

```typescript
import { engine, InputAction, TouchScreenControls } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { isMobile } from '@dcl/sdk/platform'

const ICON_DIR = 'assets/Images/spectate-mode'
const textureIcon = (src: string) => ({ tex: { $case: 'texture' as const, texture: { src } } })

TouchScreenControls.createOrReplace(engine.RootEntity, {
	hideJoystick: false,
	hideCrosshair: false,
	touchInputs: [
		{ inputAction: InputAction.IA_ACTION_3, hide: false, icon: textureIcon(`${ICON_DIR}/icon-next.png`) },
		{ inputAction: InputAction.IA_ACTION_5, hide: true },
		{ inputAction: InputAction.IA_PRIMARY, hide: false, icon: textureIcon(`${ICON_DIR}/icon-zoomIn.png`) },
	],
})
```

`createOrReplace` **replaces** the whole config (the helpers merge instead). Tear down with `touchInputs: []`. Re-call it whenever the icons should change with scene state — the spectate scene swaps zoom-in/zoom-out for raise/lower depending on whether a follow target is selected.

Combine with `UiInputBinding` (the `uiInputBinding` prop on `UiEntity`, see **build-ui**) to build custom on-screen action buttons: hide the native buttons here, then bind the same `InputAction`s to your own scene UI.

**Mobile UI sizing alongside touch controls:** `isMobile()` is the switch for the _scene's own_ UI, not for `TouchScreenControls` (which is a safe no-op on desktop). The pattern in `33,20-spectate-mode` is to branch the scene HUD on `isMobile()`: hide pointer-lock affordances, swap keyboard instruction text for joystick/tap text, render icon caps instead of W/A/S/D keycaps, and enlarge tap targets (that scene goes from 32px to 48px). [UNVERIFIED: 48px is that scene's measured choice, not a published Decentraland minimum — treat it as a sensible starting point and check on a device.]

For the button priority stack and the "+" overflow rules, custom icons, and full worked examples, see `{baseDir}/references/touch-screen-controls.md`.

## Mobile considerations

Key facts from the mobile docs expansion (commit `17ca7be`):

- **Touch-only input** -- no mouse hover states, keyboard shortcuts, or right-click.
- **`borderRadius` unsupported on mobile UI** -- avoid rounded corners in mobile-targeting scenes.
- **On-screen controls ARE scene-configurable** on SDK 7.26.0+ via `TouchScreenControls` -- hide the joystick, the crosshair, or individual gamepad buttons, re-bind the central button, or swap a button glyph for a scene image. Their positions are still fixed. This supersedes older docs claiming the mobile HUD is static. See the `TouchScreenControls` section above.
- **The old "~3x scaling for mobile" rule no longer applies as written.** On SDK 7.26.0+ pixel-sized UI is already ~2–3× larger on a phone than before (`devicePixelRatio` was removed from the UI scale factor), and the mobile virtual screen (`1600x720` vs desktop's `1920x1080`) adds ~1.2× more. Start from the desktop sizes, measure on a device, and scale up only what comes up short. See [[build-ui]].
- **UI is kept inside the device's safe area (notch, home indicator) automatically on SDK 7.26.0+** — the renderer's `screenInset` option defaults to `'device'`. Only pass `screenInset: 'none'` if you want the UI over the whole screen; the `ScreenInsetArea` component is then available to inset individual subtrees. Below 7.26.0, wrap the UI in `ScreenInsetArea` (from `@dcl/sdk/react-ecs`) yourself. See [[build-ui]].
- **SDK features not yet on mobile:** ParticleSystem, scene dynamic lights (PBPointLight), AudioAnalysis, nine-slice UI tile mode. Check the docs for the latest feature parity tracker.

## Example scenes

- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/0,1-input-modifier — InputModifier standard flags (incl. `disableWalk`/`disableJog`), `getInputCommand(IA_ANY, PET_DOWN)` to read whichever key was pressed. **Caveat:** that entity-less `getInputCommand` call is answered from every entity's `PointerEventsResult`, so it also fires on entity-bound clicks — see the correction under "Per-Entity Input Commands"; do not copy it as a global-input idiom.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/149,149-synthetic-input-showcase — 2x2-parcel rig of ten stations (S1-S10) exercising the whole synthetic-input surface under the Unity Explorer MCP: walk, camera look, click/hover, key presses, UI text entry and clicks. Source of the root-entity input-reading pattern above, the tall-invisible-`TriggerArea` fix, and the occupancy-recompute `InputModifier` pattern.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/33,20-spectate-mode — spectate/free-cam: two-entity `VirtualCamera` rig, `InputModifier disableAll` to freeze the avatar, an `onEnterScene`/`onLeaveScene` roster for cycling follow targets, and full `TouchScreenControls` + `isMobile()` mobile parity (icon swaps per state). Its README documents only the desktop bindings; the mobile handling is in the source.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/31,20-pointer-lock-control — writing `PointerLock.isPointerLocked` to request/release cursor capture; `PointerLock.onChange`.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/0,5-primary-cursor-info — reading `PrimaryPointerInfo` (screen coords/delta/worldRayDirection) each frame; feeding `worldRayDirection` into a camera raycast.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/2,22-virtual-cameras — WASD-driven controllable camera via `isPressed(IA_FORWARD/...)`; toggling InputModifier alongside a VirtualCamera.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/0,0-cube-spawner — system-based per-entity click via `getEntitiesWith(Cube, PointerEvents)` + `inputSystem.isTriggered(IA_POINTER, PET_DOWN, entity)`.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/32,20-virtual-camera-mouse-look — `PrimaryPointerInfo.screenDelta` driving mouselook camera while pointer locked; shows `screenDelta` continuing to report raw mouse movement during lock (while `screenCoordinates` freezes at screen center).
