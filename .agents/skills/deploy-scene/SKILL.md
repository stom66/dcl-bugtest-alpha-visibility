# Deploying to Genesis City

> **Not installed inside the Creator Hub agent.** The Creator Hub's skill installer denylists this skill, and because the directory holds nothing but `SKILL.md` it is skipped entirely — it never reaches the app's embedded AI assistant. The Creator Hub owns publishing through its own UI. If you are the Creator Hub assistant and a user asks to publish, point them at the app's Publish flow. Outside the Creator Hub (Claude Code, Cursor, an SDK agent) the skill works normally.

Deploy to specific parcels you own or have permission to deploy to.

**Use the `/deploy` command** to deploy. It runs `npx @dcl/sdk-commands deploy` and handles the full process:

1. Build the scene
2. Upload assets to IPFS
3. Deploy to the specified parcels
4. Requires a wallet with LAND or deployment permissions

> **Deploying to a World instead?** See the `deploy-worlds` skill for Worlds deployment (personal spaces using DCL NAMEs or ENS domains).

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, verify:

1. **scene.json is valid**:

   - `ecs7: true` and `runtimeVersion: "7"`
   - Correct `parcels` matching your LAND (for Genesis City)
   - Valid `base` parcel
   - `main: "bin/index.js"`

2. **Discovery metadata is complete** — these four fields decide whether anyone finds and enters the scene, and they are frequently left at template defaults. Check each one and fill in what you can infer from the scene itself; ask the user only for what you can't:

   - `display.title` — the scene name, shown under the minimap in-world and in the map modal
   - `display.description` — one or two sentences on what the scene is
   - `tags` — root-level array, 1-3 Places-dApp categories from the predefined list: `"art"`, `"game"`, `"casino"`, `"social"`, `"music"`, `"fashion"`, `"crypto"`, `"education"`, `"shop"`, `"business"`, `"sports"`, `"parkour"`. Infer them from the scene's theme (see the **create-scene** skill, "Tags (scene categories)")
   - `display.navmapThumbnail` — set, _and_ the image itself valid: the referenced file exists in the project (or the URL resolves), its dimensions are 16:9 (1920x1080 recommended), and the essential content sits inside the central 1080x1080 square. Check the size from the shell — `sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight <path>` on macOS, or `magick identify -format "%wx%h\n" <path>` — and open the image to judge the safe area. If it's missing, wrongly proportioned, or has the subject off to one side, recapture it — see **Thumbnail image** below

3. **Code compiles**:

   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

4. **Scene previews correctly**:
   Use the `preview` tool to verify the scene works (or `npx @dcl/sdk-commands start` manually, optionally with `--web` to preview in the Bevy Web browser client). Test with multiple browser tabs to verify multiplayer behavior.

5. **Dependencies installed**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. **Assets are within limits** — see the **optimize-scene** skill for full limit formulas per parcel count (triangles, entities, materials, textures) and the flat 330 m height limit. Keep scene load time under 15 seconds by optimizing assets.

7. **`.dclignore` covers all working files** — Blender/FBX sources, concept art, spreadsheets, markdown docs, etc. must not be uploaded. See the `.dclignore` section below.

## Deployment Process

### Using CLI

```bash
# Build first
npx @dcl/sdk-commands build

# Deploy (will open browser for wallet connection)
npx @dcl/sdk-commands deploy
```

### Using Creator Hub

1. Open Creator Hub
2. Select your scene
3. Click "Publish"
4. Connect wallet
5. Confirm transaction

## scene.json for Deployment

```json
{
  "ecs7": true,
  "runtimeVersion": "7",
  "display": {
    "title": "My Awesome Scene",
    "description": "A description for the marketplace",
    "navmapThumbnail": "images/thumbnail.png"
  },
  "tags": ["art", "social"],
  "scene": {
    "parcels": ["0,0", "0,1"],
    "base": "0,0"
  },
  "main": "bin/index.js"
}
```

`tags` is root-level, not under `display`. See the checklist item above for the valid category values.

### Thumbnail image

`display.navmapThumbnail` is the image players see in the map modal when they select the scene's parcels, and in the confirmation screen when another scene teleports them there. Always provide one.

Spec:

- `.png` or `.jpg`, **16:9** aspect ratio, recommended **1920x1080 px**. Other sizes work as long as they keep 16:9 — anything else is stretched
- **Central square safe area:** parts of the platform show a square crop of the central **1080x1080 px**. Keep text, logos and the main subject inside it. In a 1920x1080 image the left and right 420 px bands can be cropped away
- Value is a path inside the project (e.g. `images/thumbnail.png`) or a URL to an externally hosted image — an external host must serve permissive CORS headers

**Capture it yourself — ask the user if instead of providing an image they prefer you to capture it** With the **unity-explorer MCP** (see the **unity-explorer-mcp** skill), run the scene in preview, move the camera to frame a shot that shows what the scene is about — composing so the essential content sits in the middle third, inside the central square — and capture a UI-less PNG with the bundled script:

```bash
# <skill-dir> is the unity-explorer-mcp skill's base directory
<skill-dir>/scripts/screenshot.sh --world-only --png -w 1920 -o images/thumbnail.png
```

Launching the client windowed at 16:9 (`npm run start -- --mcp -- --windowed-mode --resolution 1920x1080`) makes the frame 16:9 natively, so no crop is needed. Otherwise normalize it:

```bash
# ImageMagick: center-crop to 16:9 and resize, in one step
magick images/thumbnail.png -resize 1920x1080^ -gravity center -extent 1920x1080 images/thumbnail.png

# macOS, no extra tooling: -c takes HEIGHT then WIDTH, both centered
sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight images/thumbnail.png   # read the source size first
sips -c 1080 1920 images/thumbnail.png --out images/thumbnail.png   # center-crop a larger frame
sips -z 1080 1920 images/thumbnail.png                              # then resample to exactly 1920x1080
```

Point `display.navmapThumbnail` at the resulting path. Only if the MCP is unavailable, ask the user for an image rather than shipping the scene without one. Make sure `.dclignore` doesn't exclude the thumbnail — it must be uploaded with the scene.

### Spawn Points

Configure where players appear when entering the scene:

```json
{
  "spawnPoints": [
    {
      "name": "spawn1",
      "default": true,
      "position": { "x": [1, 5], "y": [0, 0], "z": [2, 4] },
      "cameraTarget": { "x": 8, "y": 1, "z": 8 }
    }
  ]
}
```

Position ranges (e.g., `[1, 5]`) spawn players randomly within the range. Use `cameraTarget` to orient the player's camera on spawn.

## .dclignore — Exclude Files from Upload

The `.dclignore` file, always at the **project root**, lists files and patterns that are **NOT uploaded** to the content server when deploying. Everything in the project folder that isn't matched by `.dclignore` gets uploaded, and the uploaded total counts against the per-parcel MB limits — so only files the running scene actually needs should be deployed.

Format: one glob pattern per line. The default from scene templates:

```
.*
package-lock.json
yarn-lock.json
build.json
export
tsconfig.json
tslint.json
node_modules
*.ts
*.tsx
.vscode
Dockerfile
dist
README.md
*.blend
*.fbx
*.zip
*.rar
*.md
src
```

**Keep it up to date as the project grows.** Whenever working files exist in the project — Blender or other 3D source files, draft models, concept art, PSDs, spreadsheets, markdown notes, reference photos — add them (or their extensions) to `.dclignore` so the deployed scene stays as light as possible. When creating or editing a scene, add these patterns proactively; don't wait for the deploy to fail. Common additions:

```
*.blend
*.blend1
*.fbx
*.psd
*.kra
*.xcf
*.md
*.csv
*.xlsx
drafts
concept-art
reference
```

If a deploy fails with **"Scene is too large"**, checking `.dclignore` is the first step: working files are often the bulk of the excess, and excluding them reduces upload size with zero impact on the scene.

**Never ignore files the scene needs at runtime:** `bin/index.js`, `scene.json`, `assets/` (composites, .glb models, textures, sounds, video), thumbnails referenced in `scene.json`, or any file path referenced in code. Note the default ignores `*.ts`/`src` — only the compiled `bin/index.js` runs, so source code is never needed in the upload.

## Post-Publish: Asset Bundle Conversion

After every publish, the content servers compress all `.gltf`/`.glb` models to asset bundles — a significantly lighter format. The conversion starts immediately but is queued per platform (Windows, Mac). While it runs, players are deliberately served the **last fully-working version** of the scene.

- **Typical time:** **seconds.** Longer for very large scenes or when the conversion servers are busy. (This was previously documented as ~15 minutes / 30-60 minutes; corrected in docs commit `2dfbb00`.)
- **A conversion running more than a couple of minutes is a failure signal**, not normal queuing — check the status endpoint rather than continuing to wait.
- **The Jump In button appears as soon as the scene is playable**, once upload and conversion are done.
- **Before a live event:** publish your final version **at least one hour** in advance, to leave room for anything unexpected. Avoid republishing while waiting — each publish restarts the queue.
- **Check conversion status** in a browser:
  - `https://asset-bundle-registry.decentraland.org/entities/status/<pointer>` — replace `<pointer>` with a scene coordinate (e.g. `20,-34`) or the deployment entity ID. Shows per-platform status under `assetBundles` and LOD status under `lods`. For a World, append `?world_name=myname.dcl.eth`.
  - `https://asset-bundle-registry.decentraland.org/queues/status` — lists all scenes currently queued for conversion, per platform.
- **`/detectabs` chat command:** in-world, tints models green (converted) or red (not yet converted).
- **Reloading the scene is not enough** to pick up a new version — reload restarts the scene's code but doesn't fetch newly published content. **Any player who already loaded the scene this session keeps seeing the cached version until they fully close and re-enter Decentraland.** That includes you: after conversion completes, quit and relaunch, then re-enter via jump link or `/goto`.

You can also catch conversion issues **before** publishing by enabling local asset bundles in preview — see the **optimize-scene** skill ("Local Asset Bundle Preview").

## Scene Tipping

Let visitors send MANA tips to the scene creator. Add a `creator` field to `scene.json`:

```json
{
  "creator": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
}
```

When set, a **piggy bank icon** appears in the top-left for visitors. Clicking it opens a MANA tip modal. If the address is linked to a Decentraland NAME, the name is shown in the modal. Creators receive an in-app notification for each tip.

Can also be configured via Creator Hub → scene Settings → Details → **Creator wallet address**.
