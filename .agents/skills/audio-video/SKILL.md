description: Add sound effects, music, audio streaming, and video players to Decentraland scenes with AudioSource, AudioStream, and VideoPlayer. Use when the user wants sound, music, video screens, radio, live streams, or media playback. Do NOT use for player emotes (see player-avatar) or screen-space UI sounds (sounds attach to entities, not UI).

# Audio and Video in Decentraland

## When to Use Which Media Component

| Need                                                  | Component                                | Key Difference                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Sound effect from a file (click, explosion, footstep) | `AudioSource`                            | Local file, spatial, one-shot or looping |
| Background music or radio stream                      | `AudioStream`                            | External URL, non-spatial, continuous    |
| Video on a surface (screen, billboard)                | `VideoPlayer` + `Material.Texture.Video` | Requires a mesh to display on            |

**Decision flow:**

1. Is it a local audio file? → `AudioSource`
2. Is it a streaming URL (radio, live audio)? → `AudioStream`
3. Is it video content? → `VideoPlayer` on a plane/mesh

## Audio Sourcing

Before referencing any audio file path in code, check `{baseDir}/references/audio-catalog.md`. It lists 50 free Decentraland audio clips with direct downloadable URLs that cover most needs (UI clicks, ambients, music, game mechanics, sound effects).

The expected workflow when a user asks for sound:

1. Read this skill + `references/audio-catalog.md`.
2. If the catalog has fitting clips, surface them to the user as suggestions — name the clip and what it would be used for.
3. **Ask** how they want to proceed. Some creators want catalog clips downloaded; others prefer placeholder paths so they can drop in their own files later. Don't assume.
4. If they pick catalog clips: download with `curl -o assets/Audio/<name>.mp3 "<URL>"` — these URLs work directly from `Bash`, no separate tool needed.
5. If they want placeholders: use a clear placeholder path (e.g. `assets/Audio/<name>.mp3`) and tell the user which files to drop in where.
6. Reference the resulting local path in `AudioSource.audioClipUrl`.

**Things to avoid:**

- Telling the user "I can't download audio files." `Bash` + `curl` works fine on the catalog URLs — the capability is there if they want it.
- Recommending external sources (freesound / mixkit / pixabay) without first checking whether the catalog already has a fitting clip.
- Downloading clips without asking — even if the catalog has a perfect match, confirm before pulling files into the project.

## AudioSource (Sound Effects & Music)

Attach to any entity for positional sound. Fields: `audioClipUrl: string` (local file path, required), `playing?: boolean`, `loop?: boolean`, `volume?: number` (default 1.0), `pitch?: number` (playback speed, default 1.0), `currentTime?: number` (playback position in seconds, default 0), `global?: boolean`. Audio files go in `assets/Audio/`. Supported formats: `.mp3` (recommended for music), `.ogg` (recommended for sound effects, smaller), `.wav`. Keep audio files small — large files increase scene load time.

Audio is **spatial by default** — volume decreases with distance from the entity. Set `global: true` for non-spatial (same volume everywhere).

**Retriggering (play a sound again on every click):** use the helper `AudioSource.playSound(entity, clipUrl, resetCursor?)` — do NOT hand-mutate `getMutable().playing`. `playSound` writes a full component (via `createOrReplace`/`getMutableOrNull`), so it reliably re-emits even with identical params. Hand-setting `getMutable(entity).playing = true` (or the old "playing=false then playing=true" trick) can be silently swallowed by LWW-CRDT dedup when the values are unchanged — the second and later triggers may do nothing. `stopSound(entity, resetCursor?)` stops it. `resetCursor` defaults to `true` on both (start/stop at 0); pass `false` to resume/pause at the current `currentTime`.

```typescript
AudioSource.playSound(entity, 'assets/Audio/click.mp3') // retriggers from 0 every call
AudioSource.stopSound(entity)                            // stops, resets cursor to 0
```

Both helpers return `false` if the entity has no `AudioSource`, so create the component first (e.g. `AudioSource.create(entity, { audioClipUrl, playing: false })` at init).

**Detecting when a sound finishes:** when a non-looping clip ends on its own, the engine flips `AudioSource.playing` back to `false`. Poll it with the READ-ONLY getter and edge-detect the `true → false` transition — never poll with `getMutable` (dirties the component every frame):

```typescript
let wasPlaying = false
engine.addSystem(() => {
	const isPlaying = AudioSource.get(entity).playing ?? false
	if (wasPlaying && !isPlaying) console.log('sound finished') // chain next sound/action here
	wasPlaying = isPlaying
})
```

The engine only flips the flag on natural completion — a scene-initiated `stopSound()` is your own write, and looping clips never flip it. Alternatively use `audioEventsSystem` for a callback per `MediaState` change (`MS_PLAYING → MS_READY` = stopped, `MS_ERROR` = file failed to load) — see the Audio Events System section below. Both features require a DCL 2.0 desktop client with playback-completion support; on older clients the flag never flips and no finish signal arrives — don't build logic that hard-blocks on it without a timeout fallback.

Players must interact with the scene (click) before audio can play (browser autoplay policy). If an audio file needs to be ready to play the instant the player interacts, use the `AssetLoad` component to pre-load the asset.

A sound started at scene startup plays **behind the Explorer's loading screen** and the player misses it. For welcome VO, an intro sting, or music that should land on the first look at the scene, wait for `EngineInfo.sceneHidden` to flip to `false` (the loading-screen fade-out) before setting `playing: true` — see the **scene-runtime** skill.

**Pause audio when the scene is hidden:** the same `EngineInfo.getOrNull(engine.RootEntity)?.sceneHidden` flag is also `true` whenever any fullscreen Explorer UI (map, backpack, settings) covers the scene. Pause or mute audio sources in that state and resume when `sceneHidden` returns to `false`.

> **Before adding audio**: Confirm with the user before fetching audio from external sources.

## AudioStream (Streaming)

Stream audio from a URL (radio, live streams). Key fields: `url` (streaming URL), `playing`, `volume`. Non-spatial by default — plays at same volume everywhere. Set `spatial: true` with `spatialMinDistance`/`spatialMaxDistance` for distance-based volume.

Query state with `AudioStream.getAudioState(entity)` which returns a `PBAudioEvent | undefined` — an object with a `state` field (a `MediaState` enum: `MS_PLAYING`, `MS_ERROR`, etc.) and a `timestamp` field, not a bare enum. Read the state as `AudioStream.getAudioState(entity)?.state`. For callback-style state changes instead of polling, `audioEventsSystem.registerAudioEventsEntity` works on AudioStream entities too (see the AudioSource finish-detection note above).

> **Before adding a streaming URL**: If not provided by the user, confirm the source first.

## Audio Events System (audioEventsSystem)

Monitor `AudioSource` and `AudioStream` media state changes. Import from `@dcl/sdk/ecs`. The system fires a callback only when the state changes (not every frame).

```typescript
import { engine, audioEventsSystem, AudioSource } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

const radioEntity = engine.addEntity()
AudioSource.create(radioEntity, { audioClipUrl: 'assets/Audio/music.mp3', playing: true })

audioEventsSystem.registerAudioEventsEntity(radioEntity, (event) => {
  // event is PBAudioEvent: { state: MediaState, timestamp: number }
  console.log('Audio state changed:', event.state)
})
```

**API** (verified against `@dcl/ecs`, commit `f858f905`):
- `audioEventsSystem.registerAudioEventsEntity(entity, callback)` -- registers a callback for audio state changes. The callback receives a `PBAudioEvent` with `state` (a `MediaState` enum) and `timestamp`. Fires only when state changes.
- `audioEventsSystem.removeAudioEventsEntity(entity)` -- unregisters the callback.
- `audioEventsSystem.hasAudioEventsEntity(entity)` -- returns `boolean`.
- `audioEventsSystem.getAudioState(entity)` -- returns `PBAudioEvent | undefined` (the latest state).

**MediaState values:** `MS_LOADING`, `MS_READY`, `MS_PLAYING`, `MS_PAUSED`, `MS_STOPPED`, `MS_ERROR`, `MS_SEEKING`, `MS_BUFFERING`, `MS_NONE`.

The entity is auto-unregistered if it is removed or no longer has an `AudioSource`/`AudioStream` component. Works on entities with either `AudioSource` or `AudioStream` (the renderer adds the underlying `AudioEvent` component to any entity with those components).

**Relationship to `AudioStream.getAudioState`:** `AudioStream.getAudioState` is a convenience wrapper on the `AudioStream` component itself; `audioEventsSystem.getAudioState` reads the underlying `AudioEvent` component and works for both `AudioSource` and `AudioStream`. Use `audioEventsSystem` when you need callback-driven state monitoring or when working with `AudioSource`.

## VideoPlayer

Play video on a surface. Key fields: `src` (URL or local path), `playing`, `loop`, `volume`, `playbackRate`, `position` (start time in seconds). Non-spatial by default — set `spatial: true` with min/max distances for positional audio.

**Setup requires 3 steps**: create entity with `MeshRenderer.setPlane()`, add `VideoPlayer`, create `Material.Texture.Video({ videoPlayerEntity })` and apply to material. Use `Material.setBasicMaterial` (recommended, better performance) or `Material.setPbrMaterial` with emissive for a brighter screen.

Monitor playback with `videoEventsSystem`:
- `videoEventsSystem.registerVideoEventsEntity(entity, callback)` — callback receives `PBVideoEvent` on each state change.
- `videoEventsSystem.removeVideoEventsEntity(entity)` — unregisters the callback.
- `videoEventsSystem.hasVideoEventsEntity(entity): boolean` — check if an entity is registered.
- `videoEventsSystem.getVideoState(entity): PBVideoEvent | undefined` — poll the latest state without a callback.

States: `VS_READY`, `VS_PLAYING`, `VS_PAUSED`, `VS_ERROR`, `VS_BUFFERING`.

**Re-registration preserves last-reported state:** calling `registerVideoEventsEntity` on an already-registered entity replaces the callback but retains the last-reported state, so the new callback does not replay an already-reported state change. The same behavior applies to `assetLoadLoadingStateSystem.registerAssetLoadLoadingStateEntity` — re-registering preserves the count of already-reported events, avoiding duplicate callbacks. Verified against js-sdk-toolchain commit `9055b4b4`.

Share one VideoPlayer across multiple screens by referencing the same `videoPlayerEntity` in multiple `Material.Texture.Video()` calls.

To play video on a non-primitive shape (curved screens), use `GltfNodeModifiers` to swap the material of a GLTF model.

## Free Audio Files

The audio catalog is the first place to look — see the **Audio Sourcing** section at the top of this skill. It lists 50 free Decentraland clips across music, ambient, interaction sounds, sound effects, and game mechanics, each with a `curl`-ready URL.

Read `{baseDir}/references/audio-catalog.md` before recommending audio so suggestions are concrete, then check with the user whether they want those clips downloaded or prefer placeholders.

> **Important**: `AudioSource` only works with **local files**. Never use external URLs for `audioClipUrl`. Always download into `assets/Audio/` first.

### Asset folder conventions

- **Default** for audio you download yourself: `assets/Audio/`.
- **Legacy scenes** may already have audio under `assets/scene/Audio/` — that path still works; reuse it for any new clips in those scenes instead of creating a parallel `assets/Audio/` folder.
- **Creator Hub assets**: audio imported directly through the Creator Hub UI lands in `assets/Audio/` (same as the standard path). Items from free DCL asset packs land in `assets/asset-packs/` and custom items in `assets/custom/`. Older scenes may also have user imports directly under `assets/scene/`. Reference these paths as-is — never move or rename them.

Always check the scene's existing folders before deciding where to put a new file.

### Fastest path when the scene is open in the Creator Hub

Dragging a media file from the **Local Assets** tab onto the viewport spawns the matching catalog Smart Item already pointed at that file (creator-hub `062ed0a2`) — `.mp3` / `.ogg` / `.wav` spawn **Ambient Sound - Forest Birds** with `AudioSource.audioClipUrl` repointed, `.mp4` spawns **Video Screen** with both `VideoPlayer.src` and `asset-packs::VideoScreen.defaultURL` repointed. That is one gesture instead of create-entity-plus-components, and the entity arrives with the full component set and basic-view config of a hand-placed item. Prefer it over building the entity by hand when the user is at the keyboard; see **creator-hub-mcp** for the asset ids and the equivalent tool calls.

⚠️ **`VideoPlayer.src` alone is not enough on a Video Screen item.** The admin message bus re-seeds `src` from `asset-packs::VideoScreen.defaultURL` at runtime, so a `src` you set without updating `defaultURL` is silently replaced by the template's stream URL.

⚠️ **The Creator Hub viewport has a mute toggle, but only under the Bevy renderer** (speaker icon in the toolbar: *Mute scene audio* / *Unmute scene audio*). It forwards every `AudioSource` / `AudioStream` at volume 0 and the state survives a reload. Under Babylon the editor does not play scene audio at all. Silence in the editor is therefore not a diagnosis — verify audio in a real preview before changing `volume` or `playing`.

## Audio-reactive scenes (visualizers, beat sync)

For real-time amplitude + frequency-band data from any `AudioSource`, `AudioStream`, or `VideoPlayer`, use the dedicated `audio-analysis` skill. It covers the `AudioAnalysis` component (Unity-explorer only) used for music visualizers, equalizer bars, and reactive lights/particles.

## Permission for External Media

`[LEGACY]` External audio/video URLs do **not** require the `ALLOW_MEDIA_HOSTNAMES` permission. The permission and its `allowedMediaHostnames` list still exist in `@dcl/schemas`, but no current client enforces them — unity-explorer's hostname check is gated behind the `CHECK_ALLOWED_MEDIA_HOSTNAMES` compile define (set in no build config, so `SceneData.TryGetMediaUrl` just does a URL syntax check), and bevy-explorer has no enforcement. Only the retired web client enforced it. Do not add it for new scenes; current clients play external media without it.

## Video Limits & Tips

- **Simultaneous videos**: Avoid playing multiple videos at once. Only play more than 1 simultaneous video if explicitly requested. The maximum depends on each player's quality setting (as low as 1 on Low quality — see the Video Limits table in `{baseDir}/references/media-reference.md`), so treat 1 as the only safe floor.
- **HTTPS required**: Video sources must be HTTPS URLs — HTTP won't work
- **Distance-based control**: Pause video when player is far away to save bandwidth
- **Supported formats**: `.mp4` (H.264), `.webm`, HLS (`.m3u8`) for live streaming
- **Live streaming**: Use HLS (`.m3u8`) URLs — most reliable across clients

## Example scenes

Engine-team test scenes exercised against the real explorer:

- [audio-source-retrigger-test](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/89,-10-audio-source-retrigger-test) — `AudioSource.playSound`/`stopSound`, same-URL retrigger, URL-swap on one entity, `resetCursor` semantics, volume/pitch/loop variations, and why `playSound` beats hand-mutating `getMutable` (LWW dedup).
- [audio-visualization](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/88,-10-audio-visualization) — `AudioAnalysis` music visualizer (see the `audio-analysis` skill).
- [audio-finish](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/89,-11-audio-finish) — natural-finish detection via the `playing` flip + `audioEventsSystem` callback, and how a scene-initiated stop is distinguished from a natural finish.
- [asset-load](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/88,-12-asset-load) — `AssetLoad` pre-loading an mp3 alongside a texture, video and glb, with per-asset `assetLoadLoadingStateSystem` state callbacks (including a missing path resolving to `NOT_FOUND`). This is the pattern behind pre-loading audio so it is ready the instant the player first clicks.
- [gltfnodemodifier](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/74,-8-gltfnodemodifier) — `VideoPlayer` on a GLB rather than a primitive: an HLS `.m3u8` stream driven onto specific GLTF nodes with `GltfNodeModifiers` video textures. The ground truth for the curved-screen / non-primitive case above.
