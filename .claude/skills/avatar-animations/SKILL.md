description: Author custom avatar animations (scene emotes) for the player in Blender on the official Decentraland avatar rig, export them as `_emote.glb`, verify them, and hand them to a scene — including upper-body-only (masked) clips. Use when the user wants a custom emote, a new avatar animation, to animate the player/avatar, to make the avatar do something specific (sit, hold cards, carry a crate, throw, cheer), to work with the Blender avatar rig, to produce a scene emote .glb, or an upper-body / sitting / holding animation for the player. Do NOT use for playing animations baked into a model (see animations-tweens), for merely triggering emotes that already exist (see player-avatar), or for NPC animation (see npcs).

# Authoring Avatar Animations (Scene Emotes)

This skill covers **making the animation file**: posing the official Decentraland avatar rig in Blender, exporting a clip as a `*_emote.glb`, verifying it, and handing it to the scene. The scene-side API that plays it — `triggerSceneEmote`, `stopEmote`, `AvatarEmoteCommand`, the `AvatarMask` enum, the permission — lives in **player-avatar**; this skill links there rather than repeating it.

**Scope check before you start:**

| The user wants | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| A new animation *of the player's avatar* that doesn't exist yet | **this skill** |
| To play a built-in emote, or a `_emote.glb` that already exists | **player-avatar** |
| To play an animation clip baked into a `.glb` model/prop | **animations-tweens** |
| To animate an NPC | **npcs** |
| To move/rotate an entity procedurally | **animations-tweens** (`Tween`) |

## Workflow

1. **Get the rig** — `Avatar_File.blend`, never a hand-built armature. Download + bone/control/property reference: `{baseDir}/references/avatar-rig.md`.
2. **Set up** — set the scene to **30 fps** (the shipped file is 24), capture the `Starting_Pose` values, create one new action per clip.
3. **Author** — pose `CTRL_` bones only, in Pose mode, keyframing every bone you touch at every keyframe.
4. **Verify while authoring** — print world positions *and* render four angles per keyframe into a contact sheet.
5. **Export** — one clip per file, armature only, `export_def_bones=True`, `ACTIVE_ACTIONS`.
6. **Verify the GLB** — parse the JSON chunk: 1 animation, 0 meshes, 63 nodes, 62 channels per path, duration = `(frames − 1) / 30`.
7. **Hand off** — rename to `*_emote.glb`, drop under `assets/animations/`, add the permission, play it (see **player-avatar**).

Ready-made `bpy` helpers for every step — the helper module, sign detection, render/contact-sheet setup, the export call, and the GLB verifier — are in `{baseDir}/references/blender-emote-patterns.md`.

**How to drive Blender** (headless CLI vs Blender MCP, binary paths, and the rule that you must never fall back from the MCP to headless silently) is already covered in `{baseDir}/../add-3d-models/references/blender-authoring.md`. Emote authoring uses exactly those two paths; do not re-derive them.

## RULE: One new action per clip — and reset to the idle pose, not identity

Create a fresh action for every clip. In Blender 4.4+/5 actions are **slotted**, and `Action.fcurves` no longer exists (curves live under `act.layers[0].strips[0].channelbags`):

```python
act  = bpy.data.actions.new(name)
slot = act.slots.new('OBJECT', 'Avatar_Animation')
arm.animation_data.action = act
arm.animation_data.action_slot = slot
```

Before authoring anything, `scene.frame_set(0)` to evaluate `Starting_Pose` and **capture every pose bone's transform**. That snapshot — not the identity transform — is the baseline you reset to between keyframes. The rest pose of the armature is an A/T-pose; the idle the runtime blends from is `Starting_Pose`. Resetting to identity gives you a clip that snaps to a T-pose on the first frame.

## RULE: Key everything you pose, at every keyframe

`scene.frame_set()` **re-evaluates the active action and overwrites any un-keyed pose** (`view_layer.update()` does not). A render taken after `frame_set` of a pose you forgot to key silently shows the idle instead — you will debug the wrong thing. So insert keys on location, rotation and scale for every control bone you touched, plus any custom property you changed:

```python
pb.keyframe_insert('["FK > IK Leg L"]', frame=f)
```

On the **first and last frame**, also key location/rotation/scale on **every deform bone**. Channels left without boundary keys stay "open" and keep whatever a previously playing emote left there — the official docs call these *emote overrides*, and they show up as an avatar whose legs are still doing the last emote.

## RULE: Rotate the upper arms about WORLD axes, not the bone's local axes

The upper-arm bone's local X is tilted. Rotating about it sweeps the arm across the chest, and a pose that should have both arms forward ends up with the arms **crossed** — this happens in practice and is not obvious in a front render. Convert the world axis into the bone's current frame first:

```python
M = (arm.matrix_world @ pb.matrix).to_3x3().normalized()
local_axis = M.inverted() @ Vector(world_axis)
pb.rotation_quaternion @= Quaternion(local_axis, math.radians(deg))
```

- Pure forward raise → world **X**.
- Moving a raised arm in/out → yaw about world **Z**.
- Elbows, knees, wrists and fingers hinge on their **local X** (Y/Z are locked on those controls) — `rl()` is correct there.

## RULE: The rig is not mirrored — detect rotation signs, never assume them

The same rotation on `.L` and `.R` controls does not produce a symmetric pose. Determine each sign programmatically: rotate the control +15°, measure which way the downstream bone actually moved in world space, flip if needed, cache the result (`auto_sign` in `{baseDir}/references/blender-emote-patterns.md`). Verifying against a render also works, but you have to do it per joint per side.

## RULE: Seated poses — lower with `CTRL_Avatar_UpperBody`, then switch legs to FK

`CTRL_Avatar_UpperBody` is the centre of gravity: moving it lowers the **whole** body. `CTRL_Avatar_Hips` moves only the pelvis and legs and stretches the torso — wrong tool for sitting.

```python
setprop('CTRL_Avatar_UpperBody', 'FK > IK Leg L', 0.0)   # legs default to IK (1.0)
setprop('CTRL_Avatar_UpperBody', 'FK > IK Leg R', 0.0)
# ...then pose CTRL_FK_Avatar_UpLeg / _Leg / _Foot / _ToeBase per side
```

Key the properties themselves, not just the bones. Then check the feet: world Z of `Avatar_LeftToeBase` / `Avatar_RightToeBase` must stay **≥ 0** or the avatar sinks through the floor.

## RULE: Verify with numbers as well as renders

Renders catch composition; numbers catch clipping. Print world positions of hands, head, feet and any prop reference at **every** keyframe:

- Keep hands **≥ ~0.3 m** from the head centre when a limb passes the head. A throw over the shoulder clipped straight through the skull until the arm was routed outward first.
- Keep hands **≥ ~0.10 m** apart rather than overlapping at the centre line.
- Keep the **face visible** in any default/holding pose — hold objects at upper-chest height with the head tilted down, not in front of the face.

Render four angles per keyframe (front three-quarter, straight front, side, top) with Workbench and tile them into one contact sheet. Iterate in a cheap **pose-only stage** first (seconds per run), and only then do the full build with exports.

## RULE: Loops must close; one-shots must land where the scene resumes

- **Looping** clip: make the first and last keyframes **identical** (e.g. frame 1 and frame 121 for a 4 s loop) or the loop pops.
- **One-shot** clip: start *and* end in the resting pose the scene returns to — for a seated game, the seated holding pose; otherwise `Starting_Pose`.

## RULE: Export one clip per file, armature only

Delete every other object first — meshes, `WGT_*` widgets, reference planes, `Armature_Prop`, cameras, lights — and remove the `Starting_Pose` action, or the exporter emits two clips. `export_animation_mode='ACTIVE_ACTIONS'` is what guarantees exactly one animation per file. Full export call in `{baseDir}/references/blender-emote-patterns.md`.

Save an editable `.blend` (meshes included) **before** stripping, so the user can tweak the actions by hand afterwards.

## RULE: Verify the exported GLB before handing it over

Parse the GLB's JSON chunk and assert: **1 animation, 0 meshes, 63 nodes** (`Armature` + 62 deform bones), **1 skin**, **62 channels each** for translation/rotation/scale, and `duration == (last_frame − first_frame) / 30`. Verifier script in `{baseDir}/references/blender-emote-patterns.md`. A duration mismatch means the scene FPS wasn't 30.

Typical size for a 1–4 s clip at `export_frame_step=1` is **70–110 KB** — far under the 3 MB cap, so there is normally no reason to raise the sampling step.

## Upper-body (masked) animations

A masked emote is not a different file format — the **same** `.glb` is played with `mask: AvatarMask.AM_UPPER_BODY` at trigger time (API and enum details: **player-avatar** → "Emote masks"). What changes is what you should *author*.

**Which bones the mask keeps** — verified against the Explorer's `UpperBodyAvatarMask.mask` asset:

- **Animated:** `Avatar_Spine`, `_Spine1`, `_Spine2`, both shoulders/arms/forearms/hands, **all 40 finger bones**, `Avatar_Neck`, `Avatar_Head`.
- **Ignored:** `Avatar_Hips` and both legs (`UpLeg`/`Leg`/`Foot`/`ToeBase`) — these keep whatever the locomotion state or another emote is doing that frame.

Mechanically the renderer samples your clip each `LateUpdate`, then **restores the non-masked bones' local position and rotation** from the pose the Animator had already produced (`MaskedLegacyEmoteBlender`). So:

- **Hip/root motion in a masked clip has no effect.** `Avatar_Hips` is outside the mask, so the drop you authored with `CTRL_Avatar_UpperBody` to sit the avatar down is discarded; the legs show the locomotion state (idle, walk, run).
- **A masked clip does NOT layer over another emote.** Verified in the Explorer's `SceneMaskedEmoteSystem`: starting a masked emote on the local player stops any full-body emote that is playing, and starting a full-body emote cancels the masked one. So a masked clip cannot run on top of a chair's sitting emote — the avatar stands up. It layers only over locomotion, which is what the mask is for: carrying, holding or cheering while the player walks, runs or idles.
- **For a seated player, play the clip full body.** Author a seated lower body into every clip (hips lowered, FK legs bent), trigger it unmasked, and have the scene replay the sitting emote (`triggerEmote({ predefinedEmote: 'sittingChair1' })` or the chair's own) when the clip ends and no looping seated clip takes over. A one-shot that returns to the same seated pose as your looping idle clip chains into it without a pop; the only visible pop is the height difference against the built-in sitting emote, which you tune with the hip drop.
- **Author the full body anyway, even for masked use.** A plausible lower body makes the same file usable unmasked. The mask is a trigger-time decision, not a property of the file.
- **Masked emotes on the local player emit no `AvatarEmoteCommand` lifecycle events** (documented in **player-avatar**). The scene must therefore time them itself — store each clip's duration alongside its path in scene config, since you know it exactly from the frame count.

Design notes for a seated holding pose that reads well: hips ≈ 0.6 m, hands at chest height, head tilted toward the hands.

> The bone list and blending mechanism above were read from the Explorer source (`MaskedLegacyEmoteBlender`, `SceneMaskedEmoteSystem`, `CharacterEmoteSystem` on `main`, 2026-09); the "masked stops full-body" rule was confirmed in-world on a seated player. For the **enum values and call signatures**, trust **player-avatar**, which is verified against the shipped protocol.

## File requirements

| Requirement | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frame rate | **30 fps** (Blender defaults to 24) | docs |
| Max length | **10 s / 300 frames** | docs |
| Format | `.glb` | docs |
| Max file size | **3 MB** | docs |
| Sampling rate | `1` by default; `2` or `3` to shrink | docs |
| Animation clips per file | **exactly 1** (Emotes 2.0 may add 1 prop clip; sequences unsupported) | docs |
| File contents | deforming skeleton + animation **only** — no mesh, no control bones, no cameras/lights | docs |
| Start / end pose | both from the idle (`Starting_Pose`) | docs |
| Deform-bone keys | location + rotation + scale on the **first and last** frame, every bone | docs |
| Root displacement | ≤ **1 m** in each horizontal direction, ≤ **4 m** up; the mesh must stay inside `Animation_Area_Reference` | docs |
| **Filename** | must end **`_emote.glb`** (case-insensitive) | **player-avatar** |
| Scene permission | `ALLOW_TO_TRIGGER_AVATAR_EMOTE` in `scene.json` `requiredPermissions` | **player-avatar** |

Conventional location in the scene: `assets/animations/`. The glTF animation's *name* is irrelevant to the runtime — the file path is the identifier.

Blender's glTF exporter UI equivalents, if the user is exporting by hand: **Include > Limit to > Visible Objects**, **Data > Armature > Export Deformation Bones Only**, **Animation > Sampling Animations**.

The Decentraland Tools add-on's **Validate Emote** operator checks most of this (30 fps, ≤ 300 frames, exactly one armature action, first/last-frame keys on deform channels, ≤ 1 m displacement) before it will export.

## Testing in the scene

The fastest harness is a row of clickable primitive cubes — `MeshRenderer` + `MeshCollider` + `pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown` with a generous `maxDistance` so they stay clickable from a chair — one per clip, plus a **Stop** cube and a **mask toggle** cube:

```typescript
pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
	{ entity: cube, opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: label, maxDistance } },
	() => void triggerSceneEmote({ src, loop: false, mask: upperBody ? AvatarMask.AM_UPPER_BODY : undefined })
)
```

Gate the whole harness behind a config flag and remove it before publishing.

**The Explorer MCP's `trigger_emote` only plays URN/base emotes, not scene files** — it cannot test a `_emote.glb`. Use in-scene triggers (see **unity-explorer-mcp** for driving the client around them).
