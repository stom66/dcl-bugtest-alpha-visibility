name: camera-control
description: Control camera behavior in Decentraland scenes. Covers CameraMode, CameraModeArea, VirtualCamera, MainCamera, and camera vs collider interactions. Use when the user wants camera control, cutscenes, forced camera modes, camera tracking, or a spectate / observer / replay / free-cam mode. Do NOT use for input restriction during cutscenes (see advanced-input for InputModifier) or cursor lock detection (see advanced-input for PointerLock).

# Camera Control in Decentraland

## Reading Camera State

Access the camera's current position and rotation via the reserved `engine.CameraEntity`:

```typescript
import { engine, Transform } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

function trackCamera() {
	if (!Transform.has(engine.CameraEntity)) return

	const cameraTransform = Transform.get(engine.CameraEntity)
	console.log('Camera position:', cameraTransform.position)
	console.log('Camera rotation:', cameraTransform.rotation)
}

engine.addSystem(trackCamera)
```

`engine.CameraEntity` is read-only — never write to its Transform. To move a camera under scene control, drive a VirtualCamera instead (see VirtualCamera below).

## Camera Mode Detection

Check whether the player is in first-person or third-person:

```typescript
import { engine, CameraMode, CameraType } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

function checkCameraMode() {
	if (!CameraMode.has(engine.CameraEntity)) return

	const cameraMode = CameraMode.get(engine.CameraEntity)
	if (cameraMode.mode === CameraType.CT_FIRST_PERSON) {
		console.log('First person camera')
	} else if (cameraMode.mode === CameraType.CT_THIRD_PERSON) {
		console.log('Third person camera')
	}
}

engine.addSystem(checkCameraMode)
```

### Camera Mode Values

```typescript
CameraType.CT_FIRST_PERSON // First-person view
CameraType.CT_THIRD_PERSON // Third-person view (default)
```

### React to Camera Mode Changes

Use `CameraMode.onChange` to get notified only when the player toggles between first and third person — cheaper than polling every frame:

```typescript
import { CameraMode, engine } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

CameraMode.onChange(engine.CameraEntity, (camera) => {
	if (!camera) return
	// camera.mode is 0 for first person, 1 for third person
	console.log('Camera mode changed:', camera.mode)
})
```

## CameraModeArea (Force Camera in a Region)

Force a specific camera mode when the player enters an area (e.g. force first-person in tight indoor spaces):

```typescript
import { engine, Transform, CameraModeArea, CameraType } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { Vector3 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

const fpArea = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(fpArea, { position: Vector3.create(8, 1.5, 8) })

CameraModeArea.create(fpArea, {
	area: Vector3.create(6, 4, 6), // 6x4x6 meter box
	mode: CameraType.CT_FIRST_PERSON, // Force first-person inside
})
```

When the player leaves the area, the camera reverts to their preferred mode.

**Creator Hub / Inspector support:** the Creator Hub now has a dedicated inspector panel for `CameraModeArea` with a dropdown for `mode` (`First Person` / `Third Person`; Cinematic is intentionally omitted -- use `VirtualCamera` for that). A "Camera Modifier Area" smart item (utils category, translucent placeholder cube) is available in the asset catalog. The editor keeps the `area` field invisibly in sync with the entity's `Transform.scale` (the runtime reads `area`, not `scale`, for the region size), so resizing the entity via the gizmo automatically updates the camera region. Default init: `{ area: {1,1,1}, mode: CameraType.CT_FIRST_PERSON }`. Verified against creator-hub commit `a843390a`.

## VirtualCamera (Cinematic Cameras)

Create scripted camera positions for cutscenes or special views:

```typescript
import { engine, Transform, VirtualCamera, MainCamera } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { Vector3, Quaternion } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

const cinematicCam = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(cinematicCam, {
	position: Vector3.create(8, 5, 2),
	rotation: Quaternion.fromEulerDegrees(-20, 0, 0),
})

VirtualCamera.create(cinematicCam, {
	defaultTransition: {
		transitionMode: VirtualCamera.Transition.Speed(1.0),
	},
	// fov: 45, // optional: field of view in degrees (overrides the Explorer default)
})

// Activate the virtual camera (createOrReplace on first activation:
// getMutable throws if MainCamera doesn't exist yet)
MainCamera.createOrReplace(engine.CameraEntity, { virtualCameraEntity: cinematicCam })

// Return to normal camera (component now exists, so getMutable is safe)
MainCamera.getMutable(engine.CameraEntity).virtualCameraEntity = undefined
```

### Transition Modes

```typescript
VirtualCamera.Transition.Speed(1.0) // Speed-based smooth transition
VirtualCamera.Transition.Time(2) // Time-based transition (2 seconds)
```

Keep transition speeds between 0.5 and 3.0 for comfortable camera movement.

### Look-At Target

Make the virtual camera track an entity:

```typescript
const target = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(target, { position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8) })

VirtualCamera.create(cinematicCam, {
	lookAtEntity: target,
	defaultTransition: {
		transitionMode: VirtualCamera.Transition.Speed(2.0),
	},
})

// Activate
MainCamera.createOrReplace(engine.CameraEntity, { virtualCameraEntity: cinematicCam })
```

`lookAtEntity` can be `engine.PlayerEntity` to keep the camera aimed at the moving player (verified: `2,22-virtual-cameras`). To bake a fixed look direction into the camera's own rotation instead, use `Quaternion.fromLookAt(cameraPosition, targetPosition)` in the camera's `Transform`.

`VirtualCamera.create(entity)` with no config is valid (defaults) — useful for a camera whose Transform you drive manually (see the controllable-camera pattern below).

`VirtualCamera` accepts an optional `fov?: number` field (field of view in **degrees**). **Defaults to `60` when omitted.** When set, the virtual camera overrides the default FOV for as long as it is the active `MainCamera.virtualCameraEntity`. Verified against js-sdk-toolchain `PBVirtualCamera` commit `26cb9251` and docs commit `717227a`.

Choosing a value:

- **Wider (higher, e.g. 90)** — shows more of the scene at once and creates a sense of speed. Good for racing and vehicle cameras.
- **Narrower (lower, e.g. 35-45)** — zooms in and flattens perspective. Good for aiming down sights and cinematic shots.
- Very wide values distort at the frame edges; keep a fixed framing camera near the default unless the distortion is the point.

> **Teardown order matters — clear the binding first, delete the entity later.** Removing a `VirtualCamera` entity in the same frame you stop using it makes the view **jump**, and removing it *before* clearing `MainCamera.virtualCameraEntity` leaves the engine bound to a dead entity, which drops the view to the player's feet.
>
> The safe sequence (verified in `33,20-spectate-mode`):
>
> 1. Set `MainCamera.virtualCameraEntity = undefined`.
> 2. Leave the `VirtualCamera` entity (and its rig parents) **alive for ~1 second** so the renderer can blend back to the player camera.
> 3. Then `engine.removeEntity(...)` the rig.
>
> ```typescript
> let rigDestroyTimer = 0
> function rigDestroySystem(dt: number) {
>   rigDestroyTimer += dt
>   if (rigDestroyTimer < 1) return
>   engine.removeSystem(rigDestroySystem)
>   if (rigCamera) engine.removeEntity(rigCamera)
>   if (rigRoot) engine.removeEntity(rigRoot)
> }
> // in disableSpectate(): clear MainCamera, restore input, then
> rigDestroyTimer = 0
> engine.addSystem(rigDestroySystem)
> ```
>
> If the camera is reused rather than one-shot, simply keep the entity around and skip the delete.

**Switching between cameras / deactivating:** with `MainCamera` already present, mutate it via `MainCamera.getMutableOrNull(engine.CameraEntity)`; set `virtualCameraEntity` to another VirtualCamera entity to cut/transition to it, or to `undefined` to return to the player's normal camera (verified: `2,22-virtual-cameras`). Only one VirtualCamera is active at a time (`MainCamera.virtualCameraEntity` holds a single entity).

You cannot move the player's real camera directly. To move a camera under scene control, drive the Transform of an active VirtualCamera entity each frame; while it is the `MainCamera.virtualCameraEntity`, the player sees through it (verified: `2,22-virtual-cameras` controllable camera). Pair with `InputModifier` (advanced-input) to disable avatar movement so WASD drives the camera instead.

## Tracking Camera Position

Poll camera position each frame by reading `Transform.get(engine.CameraEntity).position` inside a system. For a full worked zone-tracking system (`cameraZoneSystem`), see `{baseDir}/references/camera-patterns.md` → "Tracking Camera Position (camera zone system)".

## Camera and Colliders

When a player's camera moves in 3rd person mode, the camera might be blocked by colliders or not, depending on the collision layers assigned to the entities. To avoid the camera from going through walls, you must assign both the ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS and the ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER layers to the entities that you want to block the camera.

```ts
// NO CAMERA GOING THROUGH THE WALL
// default (both pointer and physics use the invisible geometry)
GltfContainer.create(myEntity, {
	src: '/models/myModel.gltf',
})

// NO CAMERA GOING THROUGH THE WALL
// Both use the same invisible geometry
GltfContainer.create(myEntity2, {
	src: '/models/myModel.gltf',
	invisibleMeshesCollisionMask:
		ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS | ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER,
})

// NO CAMERA GOING THROUGH THE WALL
// Both use the same visible geometry
GltfContainer.create(myEntity2, {
	src: '/models/myModel.gltf',
	visibleMeshesCollisionMask:
		ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS | ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER,
})

// YES CAMERA GOES THROUGH THE WALL
// physics and pointer are on different layers
GltfContainer.create(myEntity2, {
	src: '/models/myModel.gltf',
	invisibleMeshesCollisionMask: ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS,
	visibleMeshesCollisionMask: ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER,
})

// YES CAMERA GOES THROUGH THE WALL
// physics and pointer are on different layers
GltfContainer.create(myEntity2, {
	src: '/models/myModel.gltf',
	invisibleMeshesCollisionMask: ColliderLayer.CL_POINTER,
	visibleMeshesCollisionMask: ColliderLayer.CL_PHYSICS,
})
```

## Common Patterns

For full worked patterns, see `{baseDir}/references/camera-patterns.md`:

- **Camera-Triggered Events** — use camera position/proximity to trigger actions when the player looks at an area.
- **Following an NPC (camera-follows-NPC)** — track an NPC by driving a VirtualCamera's Transform each frame (guardrail on why this works lives in the VirtualCamera section above).
- **Mouselook Camera (FPS-style)** — drive a VirtualCamera with `PrimaryPointerInfo.screenDelta` (pixel delta per frame, keeps working while cursor is locked). Accumulate into yaw/pitch, clamp pitch [-85,+85], combine with PointerLock + InputModifier `disableAll`. `screenDelta` is **top-left origin, `y` grows downward**, so pitch **adds** `delta.y` (`pitch + delta.y * SENS`) — subtracting it inverts the vertical axis. Desktop only (screenDelta always 0 on mobile). See `{baseDir}/references/camera-patterns.md` → "Mouselook Camera".
- **Spectate Mode (observer / director / replay camera)** — toggle the player from avatar movement into a free-roaming or player-following camera: two-entity yaw/pitch rig, WASD/E/F/1/2 controls, `onEnterScene`/`onLeaveScene` player roster, InputModifier freeze, and parcel-bounds clamping (the engine disables VirtualCameras outside parcel bounds). See `{baseDir}/references/camera-patterns.md` → "Spectate Mode".

> **Freezing player during cutscenes?** Combine VirtualCamera with `InputModifier` from the **advanced-input** skill to prevent player movement during cinematic sequences.

## Example scenes

- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/2,22-virtual-cameras — multiple VirtualCameras: static, `Speed`/`Time` transitions, `lookAtEntity: engine.PlayerEntity`, a Tween-driven moving camera, a WASD-controllable camera (driving the VirtualCamera Transform each frame), plus `CameraModeArea` and `AvatarModifierArea`.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/0,5-primary-cursor-info — activating/deactivating VirtualCameras with `MainCamera` toggled by key input, combined with InputModifier.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/32,20-virtual-camera-mouse-look — mouselook camera: `PrimaryPointerInfo.screenDelta` driving VirtualCamera yaw/pitch while pointer is locked, with `InputModifier` disableAll and PointerLock control. Reference implementation for the mouselook pattern.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/33,20-spectate-mode — spectate mode: free-roaming / player-following camera in one self-contained module (`src/spectate.ts`): two-entity yaw/pitch rig, player roster, WASD/E/F/1/2 controls, parcel-bounds clamping, the delayed-teardown sequence above, and full `TouchScreenControls` mobile parity (its README documents only the desktop bindings — the mobile handling is in the source). Reference implementation for the spectate pattern.
- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/9,99-modifier-areas — `CameraModeArea` forcing `CameraType.CT_FIRST_PERSON` inside a rotated 4x4x4 volume, rendered as a translucent box so the trigger volume is visible. A click handler moves the area's `Transform` to show the area follows the entity; a commented-out branch shows mutating `mode` in place via `CameraModeArea.getMutable()`. Sits alongside an `AvatarModifierArea` in the same scene.
