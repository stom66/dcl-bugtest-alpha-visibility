# Writing Script Components for Creator Hub

This document explains how to write `.tsx` files that are used inside a **Script component** on an entity in a Creator Hub scene. These scripts run as self-contained classes attached to individual entities.

## Where script files must live

Script files referenced by a Script component MUST live **inside the `assets/` folder** — use `assets/scripts/` (e.g. `assets/scripts/MyScript.ts`). Do NOT place them in a root-level `scripts/` folder.

Why: the scene's `tsconfig.json` only includes `src/**/*` and `assets/**/*`:

```json
"include": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx", "assets/**/*.ts", "assets/**/*.tsx"]
```

A file in a root-level `scripts/` folder falls outside these globs, so the TypeScript type checker (and the build's type-check step) won't cover it. The Script component's `path` field is resolved relative to the project root, so it must match the real file location — e.g. `"path": "assets/scripts/SitChair.ts"`.

## Script structure

Every script is a single exported class with:

- A **constructor** that receives configurable parameters (exposed in the Creator Hub UI).
- An optional **`start()`** method, called once when the scene loads.
- An optional **`update(dt: number)`** method, called every frame (~30 FPS; see "When scripts run" below for ordering — by default scripts update *after* all regular systems).

The first two constructor parameters must always be `public src: string` and `public entity: Entity` — do not remove or reorder them.

```ts
import { engine, Entity, Transform } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

export class MyScript {
  constructor(
    public src: string,
    public entity: Entity,
    public speed: number = 1
  ) {}

  start() {
    console.log('Script started on entity:', this.entity)
  }

  update(dt: number) {
    const transform = Transform.getMutable(this.entity)
    transform.rotation.y += this.speed * dt
  }
}
```

## When scripts run — the `priority` field (IMPORTANT)

The Creator Hub Script component has a `priority` field (separate from constructor params — it's set in the component UI, not in your class). It **defaults to `0`**, and this has non-obvious consequences:

- **Default priority `0` = scripts run LAST each frame.** At build time `@dcl/sdk-commands` groups all scripts by their `priority` value and registers ONE engine system per group via `engine.addSystem(updateLoop, Number(priority))`. Because engine systems run **highest-priority-first** (regular systems use `100000`, UI uses `100000`), priority `0` runs after everything else.
- **All scripts sharing the same `priority` share ONE system callback** and run **sequentially** inside it. A single heavy script's `update()` therefore delays every other script in the same priority group that frame.
- **To run a script's `update()` before regular systems**, raise its `priority` (e.g. `1000000`) in the Script component. This also gives it its own dedicated system. This is how you'd step a physics library (cannon.js) inside `update(dt)` ahead of systems that read the result — there is no separate physics loop.

> Higher `priority` number = earlier execution — the OPPOSITE of the "priority 1 = first" assumption. See the `scene-runtime` skill's "System Execution Order & Priority" section for the underlying engine rule.

## Constructor parameters

Parameters declared in the constructor are exposed in the Creator Hub UI and can be configured per-entity. Allowed types:

| Type | Editor UI |
|---|---|
| `string` | text field |
| `number` | number field |
| `boolean` | checkbox |
| `Entity` | entity picker (lets the user pick another entity from the scene) |
| `ActionCallback` | action picker — see "ActionCallback parameters" |
| `Slider<Min, Max, Step>` | **slider plus a number box** — see below |

Both `public` and `private` parameters are exposed to Creator Hub. Use `this.<paramName>` to access values in your code.

### `Slider<Min, Max, Step>` — a number edited with a slider

```ts
public speed: Slider<0, 10, 0.5> = 1
```

- **The runtime value is a plain `number`** — the type is a pure alias (`type Slider<Min, Max, Step = 1> = number`), so nothing changes in your code or in serialization. It only tells the editor to render a slider.
- **`Step` defaults to `1`** — `Slider<0, 100>` steps by 1.
- **An invalid declaration degrades to a plain number field** (no error): missing bounds, `min >= max`, or `step <= 0`. Negative bounds and negative defaults are fine.
- A default outside the range is **clamped**; if you later widen or narrow the bounds, the stored value is re-clamped into the new range on script reload.
- **Exported from `@dcl/asset-packs`**, next to `ActionCallback`. Scenes cannot import it yet, so the Creator Hub's script template declares a local alias — copy this line into your script file:

  ```ts
  // A number edited with a slider in the Creator Hub UI: Slider<min, max, step>
  type Slider<Min extends number, Max extends number, Step extends number = 1> = number
  ```

  (`~sdk/script-utils` is its eventual home; until then the local alias is the supported form.)

### Default values

Provide default values so the script works out of the box:

```ts
constructor(
  public src: string,
  public entity: Entity,
  public radius: number = 5,
  public label: string = 'Hello',
  public enabled: boolean = true,
) {}
```

### Optional parameters

Use `?` for parameters that may be left empty by the user:

```ts
constructor(
  public src: string,
  public entity: Entity,
  public targetEntity?: Entity,
  public message?: string,
) {}
```

### Parameter tooltips

Add `@param` annotations in a JSDoc comment block directly before the constructor to show tooltips in the Creator Hub UI:

```ts
/**
 * @param startDate - The start date of the campaign in YYYY-MM-DD format
 * @param endDate - The end date of the campaign in YYYY-MM-DD format
 * @param wearableYOffset - How many meters above the ground the wearable should be displayed
 */
constructor(
  public src: string,
  public entity: Entity,
  public startDate?: string,
  public endDate?: string,
  public wearableYOffset: number = 0.5,
) {}
```

### The `layout` field — how params are stored and resolved at runtime

The `asset-packs::Script` component value has the shape `{ value: [{ path: string, priority: number, layout?: string }] }`. The `layout` field is a JSON string:

```json
{"params":{"paramName":{"type":"string|number|boolean|action","value":<value>}}}
```

`layout` also carries `actions` (from `@action` methods) and `events` (from `@event` tags, see below), plus an `error` string when parsing failed. Only `params` feeds the constructor — but **preserve the other keys whenever you rewrite the layout**, or the editor features they drive disappear.

At runtime, `@dcl/sdk-commands/dist/logic/runtime-script.js` resolves params like this:

1. `JSON.parse(layout)` to get a `ScriptLayout` object.
2. `Object.values(layout.params)` extracts param values **in insertion order**.
3. The values are spread **positionally** into the constructor: `new ScriptClass(src, entity, ...params)`.

**CRITICAL gotcha — params are positional, not named.** The key insertion order in the layout JSON MUST match the constructor parameter order (after `src` and `entity`). You cannot skip earlier params to set later ones — every param from `src`/`entity` onward must be present in order.

Params with `type: "action"` have `value: {entity: Entity, action: string}` and are converted to `ActionCallback` functions via `createActionCallback` (which calls `getActionEvents(entity).emit(action, {})` when invoked).

This is relevant for agents/MCP tools setting Script params programmatically via `set_component` on `asset-packs::Script` — the full ordered params object must be provided. (When the scene is open in the Creator Hub, prefer its MCP `attach_script` tool — write the script file, then call it with the path and it builds the component for you; see **creator-hub-mcp**.) Example layout for a script with 14 constructor params (after `src`/`entity`):

```json
{"params":{"colorA":{"type":"string","value":"#ff33e6"},"colorB":{"type":"string","value":"#33e6ff"},"rate":{"type":"number","value":35},"lifetime":{"type":"number","value":2.5},"sizeMin":{"type":"number","value":0.3},"sizeMax":{"type":"number","value":0.6},"speedMin":{"type":"number","value":2.5},"speedMax":{"type":"number","value":4},"gravity":{"type":"number","value":-0.3},"spin":{"type":"number","value":0},"shape":{"type":"string","value":"sphere"},"shapeSize":{"type":"number","value":0.4},"maxParticles":{"type":"number","value":150},"startPlaying":{"type":"boolean","value":true}}}
```

**Verified in:** `@dcl/sdk-commands/dist/logic/runtime-script.js` — `resolveScriptParams` uses `Object.values(params).map(...)` and the result is spread as `new ScriptClass(src, entity, ...params)`.

## Referencing assets with `this.src`

If your script uses additional assets that are only loaded via code (sound files, textures, models, etc.), they won't be automatically included in the custom item folder. You must add those files manually.

Always use `this.src` to build the path to bundled asset files, because the actual file location may differ when the item is used in another scene:

```ts
import { AudioSource } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

start() {
  AudioSource.create(this.entity, {
    audioClipUrl: this.src + '/sounds/click.mp3',
    playing: false
  })
}
```

## Referencing child entities

Do **not** pass entities that belong to the same custom item as `Entity` input parameters. Entity IDs are not stable across scenes — an entity ID that is valid in your development scene may not exist in a user's scene.

Instead, find child entities at runtime by iterating over the entity hierarchy and matching their `Name` component value with a **substring** match (e.g. `.startsWith(...)` or `.includes(...)`).

**Best practice: match a substring of the child's name, not an exact name, and not a per-instance constructor parameter.** When a user duplicates a smart item or drops multiple copies into a scene, the Creator Hub editor auto-numbers the duplicated child entities — e.g. `"Sit Spot"`, `"Sit Spot 2"`, `"Sit Spot 3"`, … A substring match (`name.includes('Sit Spot')`) finds the matching child in every copy automatically, with zero per-instance configuration.

- **Exact-name match** fails on every duplicate after the first, because their names are auto-suffixed.
- **A constructor `string`/`Entity` parameter for the child name** forces the user to manually rename or rewire each copy, which defeats the purpose of a reusable scripted item.

The example below uses `.startsWith('Needle')` — a substring-style match — for exactly this reason.

```ts
import { engine, Entity, Transform, Name } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

export class ClapMeter {
  private needleEntities: Entity[] = []

  constructor(
    public src: string,
    public entity: Entity,
  ) {}

  start() {
    for (const [childEntity, transform] of engine.getEntitiesWith(Transform)) {
      if (transform.parent === this.entity) {
        const nameComponent = Name.getOrNull(childEntity)
        if (nameComponent && nameComponent.value.startsWith('Needle')) {
          this.needleEntities.push(childEntity)
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This pattern keeps the script portable: as long as the child entities have names containing the expected substring, it works in any scene and across any number of duplicated copies.

## Defining actions (`@action`)

If your script has functions that could be useful to call from other items in the scene, mark them by adding a JSDoc comment block (`/** ... */`) with an `@action` tag directly before the method. Then add an **Action** component to the entity and define a corresponding action. This lets other smart items (e.g. a button) pick and trigger this action.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY the `@action` JSDoc tag — NEVER decorator syntax (`@action()` above the method). The Creator Hub parser has no decorators plugin, so a decorator makes parsing fail and ALL params and actions silently disappear from the UI.**

An optional description line before the `@action` tag becomes the action's description shown in the Creator Hub UI.

```ts
import { engine, Entity } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

export class TreasureChest {
  private isOpen = false

  constructor(
    public src: string,
    public entity: Entity,
  ) {}

  /**
   * Opens the chest
   * @action
   */
  open() {
    if (this.isOpen) return
    this.isOpen = true
    console.log('Chest opened!')
  }

  /**
   * Closes the chest
   * @action
   */
  close() {
    if (!this.isOpen) return
    this.isOpen = false
    console.log('Chest closed!')
  }
}
```

With the `@action` JSDoc tag, `open` and `close` become available in the Actions component dropdown and can be triggered by other smart items or scripts.

## ActionCallback parameters

Use the `ActionCallback` type from `~sdk/script-utils` to let users wire up editor-configured actions as callbacks on your script. The user can then assign any action (from any item) to that callback in the Creator Hub UI.

```ts
import { Entity } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import type { ActionCallback } from '~sdk/script-utils'

export class Padlock {
  constructor(
    public src: string,
    public entity: Entity,
    public onUnlock: ActionCallback,
  ) {}

  /**
   * @action
   */
  solve() {
    this.onUnlock()
  }
}
```

### Unwired `ActionCallback` params are `undefined` (sdk-commands fix `8da580d5`)

An **optional** `ActionCallback` the user never assigns in the editor now resolves to **`undefined`**, so the obvious guard works:

```ts
constructor(
  public src: string,
  public entity: Entity,
  public onUnlock?: ActionCallback,   // ActionCallback | undefined
) {}

solve() {
  if (this.onUnlock) this.onUnlock()   // safe: no-op when unwired
}
```

**Previously** an unassigned param resolved to a truthy placeholder (`{ entity: 0, action: '' }` wrapped into a callable), so `if (this.onUnlock)` always passed and calling it logged a `console.error`. If you wrote a workaround around that — checking `entity !== 0`, or swallowing the error — remove it. On an older `@dcl/sdk-commands` the old behavior is still live, so a truthiness guard alone is not a safety net there.

Declare these params **optional** (`?`) when the behavior should work with nothing wired; a non-optional `ActionCallback` says the item is broken without one.

## Calling other scripts from code

Use the runtime utilities in `~sdk/script-utils` to call methods on other Script component instances:

```ts
import {
  callScriptMethod,
  getScriptInstance,
  getAllScriptInstances,
  getScriptInstancesByPath
} from '~sdk/script-utils'

callScriptMethod(entity, 'assets/scripts/Padlock.ts', 'solve', 123)

const instance = getScriptInstance(entity, 'assets/scripts/Padlock.ts')
const allOnEntity = getAllScriptInstances(entity)
const allByPath = getScriptInstancesByPath('assets/scripts/Padlock.ts')
```


## Smart Items are now Script-based (creator-hub `658f4daf`, PR #1354)

Most catalog Smart Items were migrated from the Actions/Triggers no-code graph to **`asset-packs::Script` code with `@action`-tagged methods** — the same mechanism this skill documents. What that means when you inspect or extend one:

- **A migrated item carries no `asset-packs::Triggers`.** Do not look for a trigger graph; the behavior is in the `.ts` file the `Script` component points at (`Door.ts`, `Seat.ts`, `Button.ts`, `Lever.ts`, `Bell.ts`, `Teleport.ts`, `Sign.ts`, …).
- **The `Actions` that remain are `call_script_method` pointers** that preserve the old public action names, so existing scenes that referenced "Open" / "Close" / "Open or Close" / "Sit Here" keep working. Their `jsonPayload` is `{"scriptPath": "{assetPath}/Door.ts", "methodName": "open", "params": {}}`.
- **The Script's params ARE the configuration UI** — the `inspector::Config` panel was removed from the migrated items. It survives on the items that were *not* migrated: the lights, the screen/media family, `camera`, `admin_toolkit`, `image`, `nft`, `text`, and the health/combat family. (Do not state that Config was removed everywhere — it was not.)
- **"When X happens" hooks are optional `ActionCallback` params.** Real names in the shipped items: `onClick`, `onActivate` / `onDeactivate`, `onReachStart` / `onReachEnd` (the two most common, on the moving-platform family), `onRing` (bell), and `onOpen` / `onClose` (the open/closed sign — not the doors). Wire them the way this skill's ActionCallback section describes.
- **State lives in a synced `asset-packs::States` component** listed in `core-schema::Sync-Components` (`{"componentIds": ["asset-packs::States"]}`). E.g. a door creates `States` with `value: ['Open','Closed'], defaultValue: 'Closed'` in `start()`; a chair carries `['Free','Taken']` per sit spot. Read and write state through `States`, not through script instance fields, or it will not replicate.

**Not migrated** (still Actions/Triggers): `click_area`, `audio_stream`, the health/combat family (`first_aid`, `healing_pad`, `health_bar`, `respawn_pad`, `robot`, `spikes`, `sword`, `barrel`, `wooden_wall`), and `camera` (Actions + Config, no Triggers). `video_player` is **`[DEPRECATED]`** (moved to the `deprecated` category) — use one of the video screen items instead.

**New items are written as Scripts from the start.** `locomotion_settings` ("Locomotion Settings", `utils`, creator-hub `cb097fff`) is the current reference example and worth reading before writing your own: nine `Slider<Min,Max,Step>` params seeded with the SDK defaults and a `@param` tooltip each, a `start()` that writes a component onto `engine.PlayerEntity` (a **global** effect, not a per-entity one — the item has no in-world presence at all), two `@action` methods (`apply` re-writes the values, `restoreDefaults` calls `deleteFrom`), and an editor-only `asset-packs::Placeholder` cube so the thing can be selected in the viewport while being invisible in-world. It carries no `Actions`, no `Triggers`, no `Config`, and no `States`. See the **player-avatar** skill for what it configures.

**`world_teleport` was removed** and merged into **`teleport`**, which gained a `world` param. `world` wins when set: a non-empty `world` does a realm change, otherwise it teleports to `x`/`y` coordinates. Update any scene or instruction referencing `world_teleport`.

**`trigger_area` is now a Script item too.** The old Actions/Triggers `trigger_area` asset was deleted in creator-hub `e43441b5`; the script-based `trigger_area_prompt` (shown as **"Trigger Area"**, id `e9fa0eab-44de-4efe-af77-a71171a1a73f`) is the only one left — the interim "Trigger Area (Script)" label is gone. Read `TriggerArea.tsx` in that item before writing a detector of your own; it is the reference for the `@event` pattern below. See **add-interactivity** for the `TriggerArea` component itself.

## `@event` — declaring hooks for reaction scripts

A class (or `start()` function) JSDoc may carry `@event <name>` tags alongside `@param` and `@action`:

```typescript
/**
 * @event enter
 * @event exit
 */
export class TriggerAreaDetector { /* … */ }
```

- The inspector parses them (`ScriptInspector/parser.ts` → `extractEvents`) and stores them as an `events: string[]` key in the Script's `layout` JSON, next to `params` and `actions`. A non-empty `events` is what makes the inspector show a **Reactions** section, with **one prompt button per event**; clicking one opens the AI assistant with a natural-language sentence already seeded ("When a player enters, …"). Declare `@event` and the no-code reaction UI appears for free.
- Tags are accepted on the **export statement, the class declaration, or the constructor** JSDoc — any of the three.
- Names match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`; duplicates are collapsed.

**The detector/reaction split this enables.** The SDK keeps only **one** callback per `(entity, event)` pair, so a second script calling `triggerAreaEventsSystem.onTriggerEnter` on the same entity silently replaces the first. The shipped pattern avoids that: one script owns the SDK callbacks and exposes `onEvent(name, fn)`; reaction scripts on the **same entity** find it with `getAllScriptInstances(entity)` from `~sdk/script-utils` and subscribe. A reaction must never touch `triggerAreaEventsSystem` itself. In `TriggerArea.tsx` the detector also replays `enter` to a late subscriber for anything already inside, and exposes `isInside()` for "while inside" logic.

⚠️ **When writing the `layout` JSON by hand, carry `events` through on every edit.** Rebuilding the layout from `params` alone drops it and the Reactions section is wiped for good — exactly the bug fixed in creator-hub `e43441b5` (editing the Trigger Area's `shape` used to destroy its prompt fields). Spread the existing layout and overwrite only the one param you are changing.

**Behavior changes worth knowing:** a seat frees itself when the sitter walks more than **1.5 m** away; `sit()` picks the **nearest free** spot; with no spot free the item shows its `takenMessage` (default **"Seat is taken"**). The avatar is moved *before* the sitting emote plays — reversing that order cancels the emote.
