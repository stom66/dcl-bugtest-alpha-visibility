description: Peer-to-peer multiplayer in Decentraland using CRDT networking with
  syncEntity and MessageBus. Use when the user wants multiplayer, synced
  entities, shared world state, broadcast events, or player-to-player
  communication without a server. Do NOT use for server-authoritative
  multiplayer, anti-cheat, or persistent storage (see authoritative-server). Do
  NOT use for screen UI (see build-ui).

# Multiplayer Synchronization in Decentraland

Decentraland runs scenes locally in a player's instance of the explorer. By default, players are able to see each other and interact directly, but each player interacts with the environment independently. Changes in the environment aren't shared between players by default.

To sync any changes in the scene state, SDK7 uses CRDT-based synchronization.

> **Runtime constraint:** Decentraland runs in a QuickJS sandbox. No Node.js APIs (`fs`, `http`, `path`, `process`). Use `fetch()` and `WebSocket` for network communication. See the **scene-runtime** skill for async patterns.

## Sync Strategy Decision Tree

Choose the right networking approach based on what you need:

| Strategy           | Use When                                                             | Persistence                                                                                                                                          | Example                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `syncEntity`       | Shared state that all players see and that persists for new arrivals | Yes — state survives player join/leave, but only as long as at least one player remains in the scene. The state resets as soon as the scene is empty | Doors, switches, scoreboards, elevators         |
| `MessageBus`       | Ephemeral events that only matter in the moment                      | No — late joiners miss past messages                                                                                                                 | Chat messages, sound effects, particle triggers |
| `fetch` / REST API | Reading or writing data to an external server                        | Server-dependent                                                                                                                                     | Leaderboards, inventory, external game state    |
| `signedFetch`      | Authenticated requests that prove player identity                    | Server-dependent                                                                                                                                     | Claiming rewards, submitting verified scores    |
| `WebSocket`        | Real-time bidirectional communication with a server                  | Connection-dependent                                                                                                                                 | Live game servers, real-time chat.              |

**Decision flow:**

1. Does every player need to see the same state, including late joiners? --> `syncEntity`
2. Is it a fire-and-forget event only for players currently in the scene? --> `MessageBus`
3. Do you need the information to be persisted even after all players leave, or to run secure validations on that information? --> `fetch` or `signedFetch`
4. Do you need continuous real-time server communication? --> `WebSocket`
5. Combine approaches freely: use `syncEntity` for world state, `MessageBus` for effects, and `fetch` for persistence.

## syncEntity Essentials

### Import and Basic Usage

```typescript
import { engine, Transform, MeshRenderer, Material } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { syncEntity } from '@dcl/sdk/network'
import { Vector3, Color4 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'
```

Signature: `syncEntity(entity, componentIds[], syncId?)`

- `entity` — the entity to synchronize
- `componentIds[]` — array of component IDs to keep in sync (e.g., `[Transform.componentId]`)
- `syncId` — unique numeric identifier (required for predefined entities, optional for player-spawned entities)

### Enum Sync IDs (Predefined Entities)

Every predefined synced entity MUST have a unique numeric ID. Use an enum to avoid collisions:

```typescript
enum SyncIds {
	DOOR = 1,
	ELEVATOR = 2,
	SCOREBOARD = 3,
}

const door = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(door, { position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8) })
MeshRenderer.setBox(door)
syncEntity(
	door,
	[Transform.componentId, MeshRenderer.componentId],
	SyncIds.DOOR
)
```

Predefined entities (with a sync ID) persist after the creating player leaves. Player-created entities (no sync ID) are removed when the player disconnects.

> **Best practice — always give singletons a stable sync ID.** Auto IDs derive identity from the creating peer + its local engine entity number (which the engine recycles). A singleton synced entity that is destroyed and recreated repeatedly with an auto ID is fragile over real network comms: it may fail to reconcile on remote clients (they see only default component data) even though it works perfectly in local single-process preview. Assign any singleton or small fixed set of well-known synced entities a STABLE explicit sync ID from a reserved enum. Reserve auto IDs for genuinely dynamic, many-instance, create-and-forget entities. Also: never `removeEntity` a fixed-ID synced entity and recreate it with the same ID in the SAME frame — the internal `NetworkEntity` survives until a later CRDT flush, so recreating immediately throws `id provided is already in use`; defer the re-spawn to a later tick. See `{baseDir}/references/networking-patterns.md` (syncEntity identity section) for the full failure-mode signature, fix, and the optimistic-prediction companion pattern.

### Auto-Generated IDs (Player-Spawned Entities)

Entities created at runtime by players do not need an explicit sync ID:

```typescript
function createProjectile() {
	const projectile = engine.addEntity()
	Transform.create(projectile, { position: Vector3.create(4, 1, 4) })
	MeshRenderer.setSphere(projectile)
	syncEntity(projectile, [Transform.componentId])
	return projectile
}
```

> **Some visuals are inherently per-player, not shared.** A `Billboard` (camera-facing) is recomputed locally in each explorer, so every player sees it facing themselves — this is not synced and needs no `syncEntity`. The exception is a `Billboard` with a `targetEntity`: because the target's position is scene state, all players see that billboard oriented the same way. Use `targetEntity` when you need a shared, consistent orientation (e.g. a sign that points at a shared object). See the `player-avatar` / `sdk-scenes` component reference for Billboard details.

## Custom Synced Components

Define custom components and sync them between players:

```typescript
import { engine, Schemas } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { syncEntity } from '@dcl/sdk/network'

const ScoreBoard = engine.defineComponent('scoreBoard', {
	score: Schemas.Int,
	playerName: Schemas.String,
	lastUpdated: Schemas.Int64,
})

const board = engine.addEntity()
ScoreBoard.create(board, { score: 0, playerName: '', lastUpdated: 0 })
syncEntity(board, [ScoreBoard.componentId])

function addScore(points: number) {
	const data = ScoreBoard.getMutable(board)
	data.score += points
	data.lastUpdated = Date.now()
}
```

> **Use `Schemas.Int64` for timestamps and other large numbers.** `Schemas.Number` / `Schemas.Int` corrupt values over 13 digits (like `Date.now()`) — always store such values in `Schemas.Int64` (as `lastUpdated` above does).

**Custom schemas must be deterministic:** the same component name must map to the same schema across all clients.

## Player-Specific Data

Use `PlayerIdentityData` to distinguish players:

```typescript
import { engine, PlayerIdentityData } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

engine.addSystem(() => {
	for (const [entity] of engine.getEntitiesWith(PlayerIdentityData)) {
		const data = PlayerIdentityData.get(entity)
		console.log('Player:', data.address, 'Guest:', data.isGuest)
	}
})
```

## Schema Types

Available schema types for custom components:

| Type                          | Usage                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `Schemas.Boolean`             | true/false                  |
| `Schemas.Int`                 | Integer numbers             |
| `Schemas.Float`               | Decimal numbers             |
| `Schemas.String`              | Text strings                |
| `Schemas.Int64`               | Large integers (timestamps) |
| `Schemas.Vector3`             | 3D coordinates              |
| `Schemas.Quaternion`          | Rotations                   |
| `Schemas.Color3`              | RGB colors                  |
| `Schemas.Color4`              | RGBA colors                 |
| `Schemas.Entity`              | Entity reference            |
| `Schemas.Array(innerType)`    | Array of values             |
| `Schemas.Map(spec, default?)` | Nested struct — `spec` is named fields (`{ x: Schemas.Int, ... }`), NOT a homogeneous key→value map |
| `Schemas.Optional(innerType)` | Nullable values             |
| `Schemas.EnumNumber(enumObj, default)` | Numeric enum; `default` is required (e.g. `Schemas.EnumNumber(State, State.Lobby)`) |
| `Schemas.EnumString(enumObj, default)` | String enum; `default` is required |
| `Schemas.OneOf({ ... })`      | Discriminated union (`$case` + payload) |

Example with the less common schema types:

```typescript
enum Rarity { Common = 0, Rare = 1, Legendary = 2 }

const Loot = engine.defineComponent('game::Loot', {
	rarity: Schemas.EnumNumber<Rarity>(Rarity, Rarity.Common),
	payload: Schemas.OneOf({
		coins: Schemas.Int,
		item: Schemas.String,
	}),
	label: Schemas.Optional(Schemas.String),
})
```

### Schema fixes landed in `@dcl/sdk` 7.28.0 — drop the old workarounds

All four were real bugs; if you are on 7.28.0+ you can write the obvious code.

| Fix | Old broken behavior | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `Schemas.Optional(...)` with falsy values (`da82bfb0`) | `false`, `0` and `''` were treated as unset — never written, read back as `undefined`. An `Optional(Schemas.Boolean)` could only hold `true` or nothing. | Presence is tested for `undefined`/`null`, so falsy values round-trip. `Optional(Boolean)` is now a real tri-state. |
| `Schemas.OneOf(...)` left unselected (`0dce4d2d`) | `create()` returns `{}` with no `$case`; serialization called `$case.toString()`, **threw, and killed the engine tick for the whole scene**. | The unset case is encoded as index `0` (real cases start at 1) and deserializes back to `{}`. A `OneOf` field the scene never sets is safe. |
| Components defined **directly from a primitive or array schema** (`5ec1a8a1`) | Every accessor tested the stored value for truthiness, so a component holding `0`, `false` or `''` reported itself as missing: `get` threw "not found", `getOrNull`/`deleteFrom` returned `null`, `getMutable` threw, `getOrCreateMutable` threw "already exists", and `create` silently succeeded over an existing falsy value. `deepReadonly` also spread non-objects, so a number came back as `{}` and an array as an index-keyed object. | Presence is asked of the map, and `deepReadonly` passes primitives through and copies arrays as arrays. |
| `ReadonlyPrimitive` narrowed (`5ec1a8a1`) | Included array types, so `DeepReadonly<number[]>` resolved back to `number[]` — a `.push()` type-checked and then threw at runtime, because the array is frozen. | `ReadonlyPrimitive = number \| string \| boolean`. Array reads now resolve through the `ReadonlyArray` branch: **`.push()` no longer type-checks.** Copy the array (`[...arr]`) before mutating. This is a **public API change**; existing code that mutated a component array read may newly fail to compile — that code was already broken at runtime. |

Related in the same release: `Player.wearables` and `Player.emotes` from the `@dcl/sdk` player helper are now **copies**, not aliases of the frozen component arrays, so writing to them no longer throws.

## Parent-Child Sync Relationships

For synced entities with parent-child relationships, use `parentEntity()` instead of setting `Transform.parent`:

```typescript
import {
	syncEntity,
	parentEntity,
	getParent,
	getChildren,
	removeParent,
} from '@dcl/sdk/network'

const parent = engine.addEntity()
const child = engine.addEntity()

syncEntity(parent, [Transform.componentId], 1)
syncEntity(child, [Transform.componentId], 2)

// Use parentEntity() — NOT Transform.parent
parentEntity(child, parent)

const parentRef = getParent(child)
const childrenArray = Array.from(getChildren(parent))

// Remove parent relationship
removeParent(child)
```

## Connection State

Check if the player is connected to the sync room:

```typescript
import { isStateSyncronized } from '@dcl/sdk/network'

engine.addSystem(() => {
	if (!isStateSyncronized()) return // wait for sync
	// safe to read/write synced state
})
```

**Note:** The function is spelled `isStateSyncronized` (not "Synchronized") in the SDK.

---

## MessageBus

Send custom messages between players (fire-and-forget, no persistence):

```typescript
import { MessageBus } from '@dcl/sdk/message-bus'

const bus = new MessageBus()

bus.on('hit', (data: { damage: number }) => {
	console.log('Took damage:', data.damage)
})

bus.emit('hit', { damage: 10 })
```

> **Authoritative-server scenes**: `MessageBus` is client-only — the headless server runtime does not implement the legacy comms event it relies on, and a module-scope `new MessageBus()` (as above) fails on the server with `RemoteError: not implemented`. In those scenes construct it only inside the client branch (`if (!isServer())`); see the `authoritative-server` skill.

### syncEntity vs MessageBus

- `syncEntity`: late joiners get current state, automatic conflict resolution — CRDT last-write-wins, so if two players change the same component simultaneously the last write wins. The state persists as long as at least one player remains in the scene
- `MessageBus`: fire-and-forget, late joiners miss past messages, good for transient effects

### Binary MessageBus (Performance Optimization)

The regular `MessageBus` JSON-encodes every payload before sending. For high-frequency messages or large payloads, there's a lower-level binary alternative that sends raw `Uint8Array` data directly — faster to process because it skips JSON serialization on both ends. This is the same transport `syncEntity` uses internally.

Use it when:

- You are emitting many messages per second (e.g., continuous movement streams, particle triggers in tight loops)
- Payload size matters (binary encoding is more compact than JSON)
- You already have binary data (e.g., pre-encoded buffers, CRDT deltas)

Stick with the regular `MessageBus` for low-frequency events where ergonomics beat performance.

```typescript
import { sendBinary } from '~system/CommunicationsController'
import { executeTask } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

// Send a binary message to all peers (or a specific subset via peerData)
executeTask(async () => {
	const payload = new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4]) // your encoded data
	const response = await sendBinary({
		data: [payload],
		peerData: undefined, // optional: target specific peers
	})
	// response.data is a Uint8Array[] of messages received from other peers
	for (const incoming of response.data) {
		handleBinaryMessage(incoming)
	}
})
```

You are responsible for encoding/decoding the `Uint8Array` payloads yourself (e.g., with `DataView`, `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`, or protobuf). There's no on/emit/topic layer — `sendBinary` is a single call that both sends pending outgoing messages and returns incoming ones, so you typically drive it from a system on each tick.

---

## REST API and Signed Fetch

For communicating with your own backend (leaderboards, game state persistence, player auth), use `fetch` or `signedFetch`. All network calls must run inside `executeTask`. `signedFetch` attaches a cryptographic proof of the player's wallet identity — use it when your server needs to verify who is making the request.

See the **scene-runtime** skill for full `fetch` and `signedFetch` patterns.

---

## WebSocket Connections

For full WebSocket patterns (reconnection, heartbeat, message format), see `{baseDir}/references/networking-patterns.md`.

### Basic Connection

```typescript
executeTask(async () => {
	const ws = new WebSocket('wss://example.com/ws')

	ws.onopen = () => {
		console.log('Connected to WebSocket')
		ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'join', playerId: 'player123' }))
	}

	ws.onmessage = (event) => {
		const msg = JSON.parse(event.data)
		switch (msg.type) {
			case 'gameState':
				handleGameState(msg)
				break
			case 'playerJoin':
				handlePlayerJoin(msg)
				break
			case 'playerLeave':
				handlePlayerLeave(msg)
				break
		}
	}

	ws.onerror = (error) => console.error('WebSocket error:', error)
	ws.onclose = () => console.log('Disconnected')
})
```

---

## Player Enter/Leave Events

Detect players entering or leaving the scene:

```typescript
import { onEnterScene, onLeaveScene } from '@dcl/sdk/src/players'

onEnterScene((player) => {
	console.log('Player entered:', player.userId)
})
onLeaveScene((userId) => {
	console.log('Player left:', userId)
})
```

### SDK Observables (low-level)

The SDK also exposes lower-level observables (`onPlayerClickedObservable`, `onEnterSceneObservable`, `onLeaveSceneObservable`, `onRealmChangedObservable`, `onPlayerExpressionObservable`, `onProfileChangedObservable`) from `@dcl/sdk/observables`. These are the primitives underlying the `onEnterScene`/`onLeaveScene` helpers above. Recent fixes to be aware of:

## GOTCHA: remote players' Transforms are world coordinates

The local player's `Transform` is scene-local; **another player's entity reports world coordinates**. Subtract `basePos * 16` to compare them (see `player-avatar` > "remote players' Transforms are in WORLD coordinates"). This bites any distance check, leaderboard-by-proximity, or follow camera that iterates `PlayerIdentityData`.

## Per-player visuals are NOT automatically shared

Some components that *look* multiplayer are **client-local**: writing them on a remote player's entity changes only what the writing client sees. They are never relayed, and `syncEntity` does not help — player entities are engine-owned, not scene-created.

- **`AvatarNametag`** (the rank/role plate above an avatar, `@dcl/sdk` 7.28.0+) is client-local. If every player should see the same plate on everyone, each client must compute and write the whole set itself.

Two ways to make a client-local visual agree across clients:

1. **Derive it** from data every client already has. E.g. sort all `PlayerIdentityData` addresses and index a fixed roster — same address list, same result on every client, independent of join order. No messages, no drift. This is the pattern in `scenes/4,24-avatar-nametag`.
2. **Replicate the *input*, not the visual.** Sync the assignment (a synced component or a `MessageBus` message), then have every client apply it locally to the player entity it resolves for that user id.

In both cases: resolve the target `Entity` from the user id on **every** write. Player entity ids are recycled across disconnects, so a cached `Entity` can land the write on a different player.

## Multiplayer Testing

Every client connected to the local preview realm counts as a separate player — but **the desktop Explorer only allows one instance at a time**. Pressing Preview a second time in the Creator Hub re-focuses the window that is already open; it does not add a second player. Two ways to get a second local client:

- **Second desktop instance**: in Creator Hub open **Play Options** (the dropdown arrow on the **Play** button), hover the **Desktop Client** row to open its flyout, and tick **Multi-Instance Preview** (requires `@dcl/sdk` >= 7.20.4); or run `npx sdk-commands start --multi-instance`. Then press **Play** / run the command again. `-n` ("open a new instance of the Client even if one is already running") forces a new window on its own. Multi-instance needs each window to authenticate as a *different* account, so it disables Skip Auth Screen — expect an auth screen per instance and sign in with a different wallet in each.
- **Desktop + browser**: leave the desktop client open and add the Bevy web client as player 2 — **Play Options** → select the **Web (Bevy)** client row, or `npx sdk-commands start --web` (alias `--bevy-web`), which opens `https://decentraland.org/bevy-web/?preview=true&realm=<local realm origin>` (`.zone` under `--dclenv zone`). Browser tabs have no instance limit.

The `decentraland://` deep link Preview fires (`realm=…&position=…&dclenv=…&local-scene=true`) is subject to the same single-instance rule unless it carries `open-deeplink-in-new-instance=true` (from `-n`) or `multi-instance=true`; let the CLI or Creator Hub build it rather than typing it by hand.

### Offline Mode

For Decentraland Worlds that do not need multiplayer:

```json
{
	"worldConfiguration": {
		"fixedAdapter": "offline:offline"
	}
}
```

## Example scenes

Engine-team test scenes exercised against the real engine:

- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/88,-13-avatar-masks — **serverless** `syncEntity`, the pattern this skill documents: an `enum SyncId` giving two singletons stable IDs, `syncEntity(crateAnchorEntity, [AvatarAttach.componentId], SyncId.CRATE_ANCHOR)` and `syncEntity(crateEntity, [Transform.componentId], SyncId.CRATE)`, plus `parentEntity`/`removeParent` from `@dcl/sdk/network` to hand a shared crate between players. Any client may mutate it — there is no `validateBeforeChange` and no `isServer()` branch. (The scene's headline feature is emote masks; the sync is the supporting half of it.)

For contrast, the other multiplayer scene in the set is server-authoritative — use it to see how that pattern differs from the serverless one described here:

- https://github.com/decentraland/sdk7-test-scenes/tree/main/scenes/90,-9-authoritative-server-leaderboard — **authoritative** (NOT serverless): only the server calls `syncEntity`, and synced components are locked with `validateBeforeChange` so clients can only read them and send messages. If you instead want any client to mutate shared state directly (the pattern this skill documents), each client calls `syncEntity` on its own and there is no `validateBeforeChange`. See the **authoritative-server** skill for that scene's full breakdown.
